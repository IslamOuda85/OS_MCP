Introduction
An operating system is software that manages a computer’s hardware. It
also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary
between the computer user and the computer hardware. An amazing aspect
of operating systems is how they vary in accomplishing these tasks in a wide
variety of computing environments. Operating systems are everywhere, from
cars and home appliances that include “Internet of Things” devices, to smart
phones, personal computers, enterprise computers, and cloud computing envi-
ronments.
In order to explore the role of an operating system in a modern computing
environment, it is important first to understand the organization and architec-
ture of computer hardware. This includes the CPU, memory, and I/O devices,
as well as storage. A fundamental responsibility of an operating system is to
allocate these resources to programs.
Because an operating system is large and complex, it must be created
piece by piece. Each of these pieces should be a well-delineated portion of the
system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions. In this chapter,
we provide a general overview of the major components of a contemporary
computer system as well as the functions provided by the operating system.
Additionally, we cover several topics to help set the stage for the remainder of
the text: data structures used in operating systems, computing environments,
and open-source and free operating systems.
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
• Describe the general organization of a computer system and the role of
interrupts.
• Describe the components in a modern multiprocessor computer system.
• Illustrate the transition from user mode to kernel mode.
• Discuss how operating systems are used in various computing environ-
ments.
• Provide examples of free and open-source operating systems.

## 1.1 What Operating Systems Do
> id: ch01-1-1 | src: book 1.1; slides 2-69 | kind: concept

We begin our discussion by looking at the operating system’s role in the
overall computer system. A computer system can be divided roughly into four
components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs,
and a user (Figure 1.1).
The hardware—the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the
input/output (I/O) devices—provides the basic computing resources for the
system. The application programs—such as word processors, spreadsheets,
compilers, and web browsers—define the ways in which these resources are
used to solve users’ computing problems. The operating system controls the
hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for
the various users.
We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software,
and data. The operating system provides the means for proper use of these
resources in the operation of the computer system. An operating system is
similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function
by itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can
do useful work.
To understand more fully the operating system’s role, we next explore
operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the system.
User View
The user’s view of the computer varies according to the interface being used.
Many computer users sit with a laptop or in front of a PC consisting of a
monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Such a system is designed for one user to
monopolize its resources. The goal is to maximize the work (or play) that the
user is performing. In this case, the operating system is designed mostly for
ease of use, with some attention paid to performance and security and none
paid to resource utilization—how various hardware and software resources
are shared.

    - CPU, memory, I/O devices
  - Operating system
    - Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users

- What Operating Systems Do
- Depends on the point of view
- Users want convenience, ease of use and good performance
  - Don’t care about resource utilization
- But shared computer such as mainframe or minicomputer must keep all users happy
  - Operating system is a resource allocator and control program making efficient use of HW and managing execution of user programs
- Users of dedicate systems such as workstations have dedicated resources but frequently use shared resources from servers
- Mobile devices like smartphones and tables are resource poor,  optimized for usability and battery life
  - Mobile user interfaces such as touch screens, voice recognition
- Some computers have little or no user interface, such as embedded computers in devices and automobiles
  - Run primarily without user intervention


- Defining Operating Systems
- Term OS covers many roles
  - Because of myriad designs and uses of OSes
  - Present in toasters through ships, spacecraft, game machines, TVs and industrial control systems
  - Born when fixed use computers for military became more general purpose and needed resource management and program control


- Operating System Definition
- No universally accepted definition
- “Everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system” is a good approximation
  - But varies wildly
- “The one program running at all times on the computer” is the kernel, part of the operating system
- Everything else is either
  - A system program (ships with the operating system, but not part of the kernel) , or
  - An application program, all programs not associated with the operating system
- Today’s OSes for general purpose and mobile computing also include middleware – a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers such as databases, multimedia, graphics


  - Overview of Computer System Structure


- Computer System Organization
- Computer-system operation
  - One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through common bus providing access to shared memory
  - Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles

- Computer-System Operation
- I/O devices and the CPU can execute concurrently
- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
- Each device controller has a local buffer
- Each device controller type has an operating system device driver to manage it
- CPU moves data from/to main memory to/from local buffers
- I/O is from the device to local buffer of controller
- Device controller informs CPU that it has finished its operation by causing an interrupt


- Common Functions of Interrupts
- Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses of all the service routines
- Interrupt architecture must save the address of the interrupted instruction
- A trap or exception is a software-generated interrupt caused either by an error or a user request
- An operating system is interrupt driven


- Interrupt Timeline

- Interrupt Handling
- The operating system preserves the state of the CPU by storing the registers and the program counter
- Determines which type of interrupt has occurred:
- Separate segments of code determine what action should be taken for each type of interrupt


- Interrupt-drive I/O Cycle

- I/O Structure
- Two methods for handling I/O
  - After I/O starts, control returns to user program only upon I/O completion
  - After I/O starts, control returns to user program without waiting for I/O completion


- I/O Structure (Cont.)
- After I/O starts, control returns to user program only upon I/O completion
  - Wait instruction idles the CPU until the next interrupt
  - Wait loop (contention for memory access)
  - At most one I/O request is outstanding at a time, no simultaneous I/O processing
- After I/O starts, control returns to user program without waiting for I/O completion
  - System call – request to the OS to allow user to wait for I/O completion
  - Device-status table contains entry for each I/O device indicating its type, address, and state
  - OS indexes into I/O device table to determine device status and to modify table entry to include interrupt


- Computer Startup
- Bootstrap program is loaded at power-up or reboot
  - Typically stored in ROM or EPROM, generally known as firmware
  - Initializes all aspects of system
  - Loads operating system kernel and starts execution


  - Storage Structure


- Storage Structure
- Main memory – only large storage media that the CPU can access directly
  - Random access
  - Typically volatile
  - Typically random-access memory in the form of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM)
- Secondary storage – extension of main memory that provides large nonvolatile storage capacity


**Storage Structure (Cont.)**

- Hard Disk Drives (HDD) – rigid metal or glass platters covered with magnetic recording material
  - Disk surface is logically divided into tracks, which are subdivided into sectors
  - The disk controller determines the logical interaction between the device and the computer
- Non-volatile memory (NVM) devices– faster than hard disks, nonvolatile
  - Various technologies
  - Becoming more popular as capacity and performance increases, price drops

**Storage Definitions and Notation Review**

- The basic unit of computer storage is the bit. A bit can contain one of two
- values, 0 and 1. All other storage in a computer is based on collections of bits.
- Given enough bits, it is amazing how many things a computer can represent:
- numbers, letters, images, movies, sounds, documents, and programs, to name
- a few. A byte is 8 bits, and on most computers it is the smallest convenient
- chunk of storage. For example, most computers don’t have an instruction to
- move a bit but do have one to move a byte. A less common term is word,
- which is a given computer architecture’s native unit of data. A word is made
- up of one or more bytes. For example, a computer that has 64-bit registers and
- 64-bit memory addressing typically has 64-bit (8-byte) words. A computer
- executes many operations in its native word size rather than a byte at a time.
- Computer storage, along with most computer throughput, is generally
- measured and manipulated in bytes and collections of bytes. A kilobyte, or
- KB , is 1,024 bytes; a megabyte, or MB, is 1,0242  bytes; a gigabyte, or GB, is
- 1,0243  bytes; a terabyte, or TB, is 1,0244  bytes; and a petabyte, or PB, is 1,0245
- bytes. Computer manufacturers often round off these numbers and say that
- a megabyte is 1 million bytes and a gigabyte is 1 billion bytes. Networking
- measurements are an exception to this general rule; they are given in bits
- (because networks move data a bit at a time).

- Storage Hierarchy
- Storage systems organized in hierarchy
  - Speed
  - Cost
  - Volatility
- Caching – copying information into faster storage system; main memory can be viewed as a cache for secondary storage
- Device Driver for each device controller to manage I/O
  - Provides uniform interface between controller and kernel


- Storage-Device Hierarchy

- Direct Memory Access Structure
- Used for high-speed I/O devices able to transmit information at close to memory speeds
- Device controller transfers blocks of data from buffer storage directly to main memory without CPU intervention
- Only one interrupt is generated per block, rather than the one interrupt per byte


- Operating-System Operations
- Bootstrap program – simple code to initialize the system, load the kernel
- Kernel loads
- Starts system daemons (services provided outside of the kernel)
- Kernel interrupt driven (hardware and software)
  - Hardware interrupt by one of the devices
  - Software interrupt (exception or trap):
    - Software error (e.g., division by zero)
    - Request for operating system service – system call
    - Other process problems include infinite loop, processes modifying each other or the operating system


- Multiprogramming (Batch system)
- Single user cannot always keep CPU and I/O devices busy
- Multiprogramming organizes jobs (code and data) so CPU always has one to execute
- A subset of total jobs in system is kept in memory
- One job selected and run via job scheduling
- When job has to wait (for I/O for example), OS switches to another job


- Multitasking (Timesharing)
- A logical extension of Batch systems– the CPU switches jobs so frequently that users can interact with each job while it is running, creating interactive computing
  - Response time should be < 1 second
  - Each user has at least one program executing in memory  process
  - If several jobs ready to run at the same time  CPU scheduling
  - If processes don’t fit in memory, swapping moves them in and out to run
  - Virtual memory allows execution of processes not completely in memory


- Memory Layout for Multiprogrammed System

- Dual-mode Operation
- Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and other system components
  - User mode and kernel mode
- Mode bit provided by hardware
  - Provides ability to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code.
  - When a user is running  mode bit is “user”
  - When kernel code is executing  mode bit is “kernel”
- How do we guarantee that user does not explicitly set the mode bit to “kernel”?
  - System call changes mode to kernel, return from call resets it to user
- Some instructions designated as privileged, only executable in kernel mode


- Transition from User to Kernel Mode

- Timer
- Timer to prevent infinite loop (or process hogging resources)
  - Timer is set to interrupt the computer after some time period
  - Keep a counter that is decremented by the physical clock
  - Operating system set the counter (privileged instruction)
  - When counter zero generate an interrupt
  - Set up before scheduling process to regain control or terminate program that exceeds allotted time


- Process Management
- A process is a program in execution. It is a unit of work within the system. Program is a passive entity; process is an active entity.
- Process needs resources to accomplish its task
  - CPU, memory, I/O, files
  - Initialization data
- Process termination requires reclaim of any reusable resources
- Single-threaded process has one program counter specifying location of next instruction to execute
  - Process executes instructions sequentially, one at a time, until completion
- Multi-threaded process has one program counter per thread
- Typically system has many processes, some user, some operating system running concurrently on one or more CPUs
  - Concurrency by multiplexing the CPUs among the processes / threads


- Process Management Activities
- Creating and deleting both user and system processes
- Suspending and resuming processes
- Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
- Providing mechanisms for process communication
- Providing mechanisms for deadlock handling
- The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with process management:


- Memory Management
- To execute a program all (or part) of the instructions must be in memory
- All  (or part) of the data that is needed by the program must be in memory
- Memory management determines what is in memory and when
  - Optimizing CPU utilization and computer response to users
- Memory management activities
  - Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
  - Deciding which processes (or parts thereof) and data to move into and out of memory
  - Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed


- File-system Management
- OS provides uniform, logical view of information storage
  - Abstracts physical properties to logical storage unit  - file
  - Each medium is controlled by device (i.e., disk drive, tape drive)
    - Varying properties include access speed, capacity, data-transfer rate, access method (sequential or random)
- File-System management
  - Files usually organized into directories
  - Access control on most systems to determine who can access what
  - OS activities include
    - Creating and deleting files and directories
    - Primitives to manipulate files and directories
    - Mapping files onto secondary storage
    - Backup files onto stable (non-volatile) storage media


- Mass-Storage Management
- Usually disks used to store data that does not fit in main memory or data that must be kept for a “long” period of time
- Proper management is of central importance
- Entire speed of computer operation hinges on disk subsystem and its algorithms
- OS activities
  - Mounting and unmounting
  - Free-space management
  - Storage allocation
  - Disk scheduling
  - Partitioning
  - Protection


- Caching
- Important principle, performed at many levels in a computer (in hardware, operating system, software)
- Information in use copied from slower to faster storage temporarily
- Faster storage (cache) checked first to determine if information is there
  - If it is, information used directly from the cache (fast)
  - If not, data copied to cache and used there
- Cache smaller than storage being cached
  - Cache management important design problem
  - Cache size and replacement policy


- Characteristics of Various Types of Storage
- Movement between levels of storage hierarchy can be explicit or implicit

- Migration of data “A” from Disk to Register
- Multitasking environments must be careful to use most recent value, no matter where it is stored in the storage hierarchy
- Multiprocessor environment must provide cache coherency in hardware such that all CPUs have the most recent value in their cache
- Distributed environment situation even more complex
  - Several copies of a datum can exist
  - Various solutions covered in Chapter 19

- I/O Subsystem
- One purpose of OS is to hide peculiarities of hardware devices from the user
- I/O subsystem responsible for
  - Memory management of I/O including buffering (storing data temporarily while it is being transferred), caching (storing parts of data in faster storage for performance), spooling (the overlapping of output of one job with input of other jobs)
  - General device-driver interface
  - Drivers for specific hardware devices


- Protection and Security
- Protection – any mechanism for controlling access of processes or users to resources defined by the OS
- Security – defense of the system against internal and external attacks
  - Huge range, including denial-of-service, worms, viruses, identity theft, theft of service
- Systems generally first distinguish among users, to determine who can do what
  - User identities (user IDs, security IDs) include name and associated number, one per user
  - User ID then associated with all files, processes of that user to determine access control
  - Group identifier (group ID) allows set of users to be defined and controls managed, then also associated with each process, file
  - Privilege escalation allows user to change to effective ID with more rights


- Virtualization
- Allows operating systems to run applications within other OSes
  - Vast and growing industry
- Emulation used when source CPU type different from target type (i.e. PowerPC to Intel x86)
  - Generally slowest method
  - When computer language not compiled to native code – Interpretation
- Virtualization – OS natively compiled for CPU, running guest OSes  also natively compiled
  - Consider VMware running WinXP guests, each running applications, all on native WinXP host OS
  - VMM (virtual machine Manager) provides virtualization services


- Virtualization (cont.)
- Use cases involve laptops and desktops running multiple OSes for exploration or compatibility
  - Apple laptop running Mac OS X host, Windows as a guest
  - Developing apps for multiple OSes without having multiple systems
  - Quality assurance testing applications without having multiple systems
  - Executing and managing compute environments within data centers
- VMM can run natively, in which case they are also the host
  - There is no general-purpose host then (VMware ESX and Citrix XenServer)


- Computing Environments - Virtualization

  - Also known as parallel systems, tightly-coupled systems
  - Advantages include:
    - Increased throughput
    - Economy of scale
    - Increased reliability – graceful degradation or fault tolerance
  - Two types:
    - Asymmetric Multiprocessing – each processor is assigned a specie task.
    - Symmetric Multiprocessing – each processor performs all tasks


- Symmetric Multiprocessing Architecture

- Clustered Systems
- Like multiprocessor systems, but multiple systems working together
  - Usually sharing storage via a storage-area network (SAN)
  - Provides a high-availability service which survives failures
    - Asymmetric clustering has one machine in hot-standby mode
    - Symmetric clustering has multiple nodes running applications, monitoring each other
  - Some clusters are for high-performance computing (HPC)
    - Applications must be written to use parallelization
  - Some have distributed lock manager (DLM) to avoid conflicting operations


- Clustered Systems

- In addition, the rise of virtualization as a mainstream (and frequently free) computer function
- makes it possible to run many operating systems on top of one core system. For example, VMware

- hundreds of operating systems without dedicated hardware.
- The advent of open-source operating systems has also made it easier to make the move from
- student to operating-system developer. With some knowledge, some effort, and an Internet
- connection, a student can even create a new operating-system distribution. Just a few years ago,
- it was difficult or impossible to get access to source code. Now, such access is limited only by
- how much interest, time, and disk space a student has.


## 1.1 What Operating Systems Do
> id: ch01-1-1 | src: book 1.1 | kind: concept

Increasingly, many users interact with mobile devices such as smartphones
and tablets—devices that are replacing desktop and laptop computer systems
for some users. These devices are typically connected to networks through
cellular or other wireless technologies. The user interface for mobile computers
generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by
pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a physical
keyboard and mouse. Many mobile devices also allow users to interact through
a voice recognition interface, such as Apple’s Siri.
Some computers have little or no user view. For example, embedded com-
puters in home devices and automobiles may have numeric keypads and may
turn indicator lights on or off to show status, but they and their operating sys-
tems and applications are designed primarily to run without user intervention.
System View
From the computer’s point of view, the operating system is the program most
intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, we can view an oper-
ating system as a resource allocator. A computer system has many resources
that may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, storage
space, I/O devices, and so on. The operating system acts as the manager of these
resources. Facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources, the
operating system must decide how to allocate them to specific programs and
users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly.
A slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to
control the various I/O devices and user programs. An operating system is a
control program. A control program manages the execution of user programs
to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned
with the operation and control of I/O devices.
Deﬁning Operating Systems
By now, you can probably see that the term operating system covers many
roles and functions. That is the case, at least in part, because of the myriad
designs and uses of computers. Computers are present within toasters, cars,
ships, spacecraft, homes, and businesses. They are the basis for game machines,
cable TV tuners, and industrial control systems.
To explain this diversity, we can turn to the history of computers. Although
computers have a relatively short history, they have evolved rapidly. Comput-
ing started as an experiment to determine what could be done and quickly
moved to fixed-purpose systems for military uses, such as code breaking and
trajectory plotting, and governmental uses, such as census calculation. Those
early computers evolved into general-purpose, multifunction mainframes, and
that’s when operating systems were born. In the 1960s, Moore’s Law predicted
that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every 18
months, and that prediction has held true. Computers gained in functionality
and shrank in size, leading to a vast number of uses and a vast number and
variety of operating systems. (See Appendix A for more details on the history
of operating systems.)
How, then, can we define what an operating system is? In general, we have
no completely adequate definition of an operating system. Operating systems
Introduction
exist because they offer a reasonable way to solve the problem of creating
a usable computing system. The fundamental goal of computer systems is
to execute programs and to make solving user problems easier. Computer
hardware is constructed toward this goal. Since bare hardware alone is not
particularly easy to use, application programs are developed. These programs
require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices.
The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought
together into one piece of software: the operating system.
In addition, we have no universally accepted definition of what is part of
the operating system. A simple viewpoint is that it includes everything a ven-
dor ships when you order “the operating system.” The features included, how-
ever, vary greatly across systems. Some systems take up less than a megabyte
of space and lack even a full-screen editor, whereas others require gigabytes
of space and are based entirely on graphical windowing systems. A more com-
mon definition, and the one that we usually follow, is that the operating system
is the one program running at all times on the computer—usually called the
kernel. Along with the kernel, there are two other types of programs: system
programs, which are associated with the operating system but are not neces-
sarily part of the kernel, and application programs, which include all programs
not associated with the operation of the system.
The matter of what constitutes an operating system became increasingly
important as personal computers became more widespread and operating sys-
tems grew increasingly sophisticated. In 1998, the United States Department of
Justice filed suit against Microsoft, in essence claiming that Microsoft included
too much functionality in its operating systems and thus prevented application
vendors from competing. (For example, a web browser was an integral part of
Microsoft’s operating systems.) As a result, Microsoft was found guilty of using
its operating-system monopoly to limit competition.
Today, however, if we look at operating systems for mobile devices, we
see that once again the number of features constituting the operating system
is increasing. Mobile operating systems often include not only a core kernel
but also middleware—a set of software frameworks that provide additional
services to application developers. For example, each of the two most promi-
nent mobile operating systems—Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android—features
WHY STUDY OPERATING SYSTEMS?
Although there are many practitioners of computer science, only a small per-
centage of them will be involved in the creation or modification of an operat-
ing system. Why, then, study operating systems and how they work? Simply
because, as almost all code runs on top of an operating system, knowledge
of how operating systems work is crucial to proper, efficient, effective, and
secure programming. Understanding the fundamentals of operating systems,
how they drive computer hardware, and what they provide to applications is
not only essential to those who program them but also highly useful to those
who write programs on them and use them.

a core kernel along with middleware that supports databases, multimedia, and
graphics (to name only a few).
In summary, for our purposes, the operating system includes the always-
running kernel, middleware frameworks that ease application development
and provide features, and system programs that aid in managing the system
while it is running. Most of this text is concerned with the kernel of general-
purpose operating systems, but other components are discussed as needed to
fully explain operating system design and operation.


## 1.2 Computer-System Organization
> id: ch01-1-2 | src: book 1.2 | kind: concept

A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and
a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides
access between components and shared memory (Figure 1.2). Each device
controller is in charge of a specific type of device (for example, a disk drive,
audio device, or graphics display). Depending on the controller, more than one
device may be attached. For instance, one system USB port can connect to a
USB hub, to which several devices can connect. A device controller maintains
some local buffer storage and a set of special-purpose registers. The device
controller is responsible for moving the data between the peripheral devices
that it controls and its local buffer storage.
Typically, operating systems have a device driver for each device con-
troller. This device driver understands the device controller and provides the
rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device. The CPU and
the device controllers can execute in parallel, competing for memory cycles. To
ensure orderly access to the shared memory, a memory controller synchronizes
access to the memory.
In the following subsections, we describe some basics of how such a system
operates, focusing on three key aspects of the system. We start with interrupts,
which alert the CPU to events that require attention. We then discuss storage
structure and I/O structure.

Introduction
Interrupts
Consider a typical computer operation: a program performing I/O. To start an
I/O operation, the device driver loads the appropriate registers in the device
controller. The device controller, in turn, examines the contents of these reg-
isters to determine what action to take (such as “read a character from the
keyboard”). The controller starts the transfer of data from the device to its local
buffer. Once the transfer of data is complete, the device controller informs the
device driver that it has finished its operation. The device driver then gives
control to other parts of the operating system, possibly returning the data or a
pointer to the data if the operation was a read. For other operations, the device
driver returns status information such as “write completed successfully” or
“device busy”. But how does the controller inform the device driver that it has
finished its operation? This is accomplished via an interrupt.
Overview
Hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a signal to the
CPU, usually by way of the system bus. (There may be many buses within
a computer system, but the system bus is the main communications path
between the major components.) Interrupts are used for many other purposes
as well and are a key part of how operating systems and hardware interact.
When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately
transfers execution to a fixed location. The fixed location usually contains
the starting address where the service routine for the interrupt is located.
The interrupt service routine executes; on completion, the CPU resumes the
interrupted computation. A timeline of this operation is shown in Figure 1.3.
To run the animation assicated with this figure please click here.
Interrupts are an important part of a computer architecture. Each computer
design has its own interrupt mechanism, but several functions are common.
The interrupt must transfer control to the appropriate interrupt service routine.
The straightforward method for managing this transfer would be to invoke
a generic routine to examine the interrupt information. The routine, in turn,

## 1.2 Computer-System Organization
> id: ch01-1-2 | src: book 1.2 | kind: concept

would call the interrupt-specific handler. However, interrupts must be handled
quickly, as they occur very frequently. A table of pointers to interrupt routines
can be used instead to provide the necessary speed. The interrupt routine
is called indirectly through the table, with no intermediate routine needed.
Generally, the table of pointers is stored in low memory (the first hundred or so
locations). These locations hold the addresses of the interrupt service routines
for the various devices. This array, or interrupt vector, of addresses is then
indexed by a unique number, given with the interrupt request, to provide the
address of the interrupt service routine for the interrupting device. Operating
systems as different as Windows and UNIX dispatch interrupts in this manner.
The interrupt architecture must also save the state information of whatever
was interrupted, so that it can restore this information after servicing the
interrupt. If the interrupt routine needs to modify the processor state—for
instance, by modifying register values—it must explicitly save the current state
and then restore that state before returning. After the interrupt is serviced, the
saved return address is loaded into the program counter, and the interrupted
computation resumes as though the interrupt had not occurred.
Implementation
The basic interrupt mechanism works as follows. The CPU hardware has a
wire called the interrupt-request line that the CPU senses after executing every
instruction. When the CPU detects that a controller has asserted a signal on
the interrupt-request line, it reads the interrupt number and jumps to the
interrupt-handler routine by using that interrupt number as an index into
the interrupt vector. It then starts execution at the address associated with
that index. The interrupt handler saves any state it will be changing during
its operation, determines the cause of the interrupt, performs the necessary
processing, performs a state restore, and executes a return from interrupt
instruction to return the CPU to the execution state prior to the interrupt. We
say that the device controller raises an interrupt by asserting a signal on the
interrupt request line, the CPU catches the interrupt and dispatches it to the
interrupt handler, and the handler clears the interrupt by servicing the device.
Figure 1.4 summarizes the interrupt-driven I/O cycle.
The basic interrupt mechanism just described enables the CPU to respond to
an asynchronous event, as when a device controller becomes ready for service.
In a modern operating system, however, we need more sophisticated interrupt-
handling features.
1. We need the ability to defer interrupt handling during critical processing.
2. We need an efficient way to dispatch to the proper interrupt handler for
a device.
3. We need multilevel interrupts, so that the operating system can distin-
guish between high- and low-priority interrupts and can respond with
the appropriate degree of urgency.
In modern computer hardware, these three features are provided by the CPU
and the interrupt-controller hardware.

Most CPUs have two interrupt request lines. One is the nonmaskable
interrupt, which is reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors.
The second interrupt line is maskable: it can be turned off by the CPU before
the execution of critical instruction sequences that must not be interrupted. The
maskable interrupt is used by device controllers to request service.
Recall that the purpose of a vectored interrupt mechanism is to reduce the
need for a single interrupt handler to search all possible sources of interrupts
to determine which one needs service. In practice, however, computers have
more devices (and, hence, interrupt handlers) than they have address elements
in the interrupt vector. A common way to solve this problem is to use interrupt
chaining, in which each element in the interrupt vector points to the head of
a list of interrupt handlers. When an interrupt is raised, the handlers on the
corresponding list are called one by one, until one is found that can service
the request. This structure is a compromise between the overhead of a huge
interrupt table and the inefficiency of dispatching to a single interrupt handler.
Figure 1.5 illustrates the design of the interrupt vector for Intel processors.
The events from 0 to 31, which are nonmaskable, are used to signal various
error conditions. The events from 32 to 255, which are maskable, are used for
purposes such as device-generated interrupts.
The interrupt mechanism also implements a system of interrupt priority
levels. These levels enable the CPU to defer the handling of low-priority inter-

rupts without masking all interrupts and makes it possible for a high-priority
interrupt to preempt the execution of a low-priority interrupt.
In summary, interrupts are used throughout modern operating systems to
handle asynchronous events (and for other purposes we will discuss through-
out the text). Device controllers and hardware faults raise interrupts. To enable
the most urgent work to be done first, modern computers use a system of
interrupt priorities. Because interrupts are used so heavily for time-sensitive
processing, efficient interrupt handling is required for good system perfor-
mance.
Storage Structure
The CPU can load instructions only from memory, so any programs must
first be loaded into memory to run. General-purpose computers run most
of their programs from rewritable memory, called main memory (also called
random-access memory, or RAM). Main memory commonly is implemented in
a semiconductor technology called dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).
Computers use other forms of memory as well. For example, the first pro-
gram to run on computer power-on is a bootstrap program, which then loads
the operating system. Since RAM is volatile—loses its content when power
is turned off or otherwise lost—we cannot trust it to hold the bootstrap pro-
gram. Instead, for this and some other purposes, the computer uses electri-
cally erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) and other forms of
firmwar —storage that is infrequently written to and is nonvolatile. EEPROM
Introduction
STORAGE DEFINITIONS AND NOTATION
The basic unit of computer storage is the bit. A bit can contain one of two
values, 0 and 1. All other storage in a computer is based on collections of bits.
Given enough bits, it is amazing how many things a computer can represent:
numbers, letters, images, movies, sounds, documents, and programs, to name
a few. A byte is 8 bits, and on most computers it is the smallest convenient
chunk of storage. For example, most computers don’t have an instruction to
move a bit but do have one to move a byte. A less common term is word,
which is a given computer architecture’s native unit of data. A word is made
up of one or more bytes. For example, a computer that has 64-bit registers and
64-bit memory addressing typically has 64-bit (8-byte) words. A computer
executes many operations in its native word size rather than a byte at a time.
Computer storage, along with most computer throughput, is generally
measured and manipulated in bytes and collections of bytes. A kilobyte, or
KB, is 1,024 bytes; a megabyte, or MB, is 1,0242 bytes; a gigabyte, or GB, is
1,0243 bytes; a terabyte, or TB, is 1,0244 bytes; and a petabyte, or PB, is 1,0245
bytes. Computer manufacturers often round off these numbers and say that
a megabyte is 1 million bytes and a gigabyte is 1 billion bytes. Networking
measurements are an exception to this general rule; they are given in bits
(because networks move data a bit at a time).
can be changed but cannot be changed frequently. In addition, it is low speed,
and so it contains mostly static programs and data that aren’t frequently used.
For example, the iPhone uses EEPROM to store serial numbers and hardware
information about the device.
All forms of memory provide an array of bytes. Each byte has its own
address. Interaction is achieved through a sequence of load or store instruc-
tions to specific memory addresses. The load instruction moves a byte or word
from main memory to an internal register within the CPU, whereas the store
instruction moves the content of a register to main memory. Aside from explicit
loads and stores, the CPU automatically loads instructions from main memory
for execution from the location stored in the program counter.
A typical instruction–execution cycle, as executed on a system with a von
Neumann architecture, first fetches an instruction from memory and stores
that instruction in the instruction register. The instruction is then decoded
and may cause operands to be fetched from memory and stored in some
internal register. After the instruction on the operands has been executed, the
result may be stored back in memory. Notice that the memory unit sees only
a stream of memory addresses. It does not know how they are generated (by
the instruction counter, indexing, indirection, literal addresses, or some other
means) or what they are for (instructions or data). Accordingly, we can ignore
how a memory address is generated by a program. We are interested only in
the sequence of memory addresses generated by the running program.
Ideally, we want the programs and data to reside in main memory per-
manently. This arrangement usually is not possible on most systems for two
reasons:


## 1.2 Computer-System Organization
> id: ch01-1-2 | src: book 1.2 | kind: concept

1. Main memory is usually too small to store all needed programs and data
permanently.
2. Main memory, as mentioned, is volatile—it loses its contents when power
is turned off or otherwise lost.
Thus, most computer systems provide secondary storage as an extension of
main memory. The main requirement for secondary storage is that it be able to
hold large quantities of data permanently.
The most common secondary-storage devices are hard-disk drives (HDDs)
and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices, which provide storage for both
programs and data. Most programs (system and application) are stored in
secondary storage until they are loaded into memory. Many programs then use
secondary storage as both the source and the destination of their processing.
Secondary storage is also much slower than main memory. Hence, the proper
management of secondary storage is of central importance to a computer sys-
In a larger sense, however, the storage structure that we have described
—consisting of registers, main memory, and secondary storage—is only one
of many possible storage system designs. Other possible components include
cache memory, CD-ROM or blu-ray, magnetic tapes, and so on. Those that are
slow enough and large enough that they are used only for special purposes
—to store backup copies of material stored on other devices, for example—
are called tertiary storage. Each storage system provides the basic functions
of storing a datum and holding that datum until it is retrieved at a later time.
The main differences among the various storage systems lie in speed, size, and
volatility.
The wide variety of storage systems can be organized in a hierarchy (Figure
1.6) according to storage capacity and access time. As a general rule, there is a

Introduction
trade-off between size and speed, with smaller and faster memory closer to the
CPU. As shown in the figure, in addition to differing in speed and capacity, the
various storage systems are either volatile or nonvolatile. Volatile storage, as
mentioned earlier, loses its contents when the power to the device is removed,
so data must be written to nonvolatile storage for safekeeping.
The top four levels of memory in the figure are constructed using semi-
conductor memory, which consists of semiconductor-based electronic circuits.
NVM devices, at the fourth level, have several variants but in general are faster
than hard disks. The most common form of NVM device is flash memory, which
is popular in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Increasingly,
flash memory is being used for long-term storage on laptops, desktops, and
servers as well.
Since storage plays an important role in operating-system structure, we
will refer to it frequently in the text. In general, we will use the following
terminology:
• Volatile storage will be referred to simply as memory. If we need to empha-
size a particular type of storage device (for example, a register),we will do
so explicitly.
• Nonvolatile storage retains its contents when power is lost. It will be
referred to as NVS. The vast majority of the time we spend on NVS will
be on secondary storage. This type of storage can be classified into two
distinct types:
◦Mechanical. A few examples of such storage systems are HDDs, optical
disks, holographic storage, and magnetic tape. If we need to emphasize
a particular type of mechanical storage device (for example, magnetic
tape), we will do so explicitly.
◦Electrical. A few examples of such storage systems are flash memory,
FRAM, NRAM, and SSD. Electrical storage will be referred to as NVM. If
we need to emphasize a particular type of electrical storage device (for
example, SSD), we will do so explicitly.
Mechanical storage is generally larger and less expensive per byte than
electrical storage. Conversely, electrical storage is typically costly, smaller,
and faster than mechanical storage.
The design of a complete storage system must balance all the factors just
discussed: it must use only as much expensive memory as necessary while
providing as much inexpensive, nonvolatile storage as possible. Caches can
be installed to improve performance where a large disparity in access time or
transfer rate exists between two components.
I/O Structure
A large portion of operating system code is dedicated to managing I/O, both
because of its importance to the reliability and performance of a system and
because of the varying nature of the devices.
Recall from the beginning of this section that a general-purpose computer
system consists of multiple devices, all of which exchange data via a common

bus. The form of interrupt-driven I/O described in Section 1.2.1 is fine for
moving small amounts of data but can produce high overhead when used for
bulk data movement such as NVS I/O. To solve this problem, direct memory
access (DMA) is used. After setting up buffers, pointers, and counters for the
I/O device, the device controller transfers an entire block of data directly to
or from the device and main memory, with no intervention by the CPU. Only
one interrupt is generated per block, to tell the device driver that the operation
has completed, rather than the one interrupt per byte generated for low-speed
devices. While the device controller is performing these operations, the CPU is
available to accomplish other work.
Some high-end systems use switch rather than bus architecture. On these
systems, multiple components can talk to other components concurrently,
rather than competing for cycles on a shared bus. In this case, DMA is even
more effective. Figure 1.7 shows the interplay of all components of a computer
system.


## 1.3 Computer-System Architecture
> id: ch01-1-3 | src: book 1.3 | kind: concept

In Section 1.2, we introduced the general structure of a typical computer sys-
tem. A computer system can be organized in a number of different ways,
which we can categorize roughly according to the number of general-purpose
processors used.
Single-Processor Systems
Many years ago, most computer systems used a single processor containing
one CPU with a single processing core. The core is the component that exe-
cutes instructions and registers for storing data locally. The one main CPU with
its core is capable of executing a general-purpose instruction set, including
instructions from processes. These systems have other special-purpose proces-
Introduction
sors as well. They may come in the form of device-specific processors, such as
disk, keyboard, and graphics controllers.
All of these special-purpose processors run a limited instruction set and
do not run processes. Sometimes, they are managed by the operating system,
in that the operating system sends them information about their next task and
monitors their status. For example, a disk-controller microprocessor receives
a sequence of requests from the main CPU core and implements its own disk
queue and scheduling algorithm. This arrangement relieves the main CPU of
the overhead of disk scheduling. PCs contain a microprocessor in the keyboard
to convert the keystrokes into codes to be sent to the CPU. In other systems or
circumstances, special-purpose processors are low-level components built into
the hardware. The operating system cannot communicate with these proces-
sors; they do their jobs autonomously. The use of special-purpose microproces-
sors is common and does not turn a single-processor system into a multiproces-
sor. If there is only one general-purpose CPU with a single processing core, then
the system is a single-processor system. According to this definition, however,
very few contemporary computer systems are single-processor systems.
Multiprocessor Systems
On modern computers, from mobile devices to servers, multiprocessor sys-
tems now dominate the landscape of computing. Traditionally, such systems
have two (or more) processors, each with a single-core CPU. The proces-
sors share the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and periph-
eral devices. The primary advantage of multiprocessor systems is increased
throughput. That is, by increasing the number of processors, we expect to get
more work done in less time. The speed-up ratio with N processors is not N,
however; it is less than N. When multiple processors cooperate on a task, a cer-
tain amount of overhead is incurred in keeping all the parts working correctly.
This overhead, plus contention for shared resources, lowers the expected gain
from additional processors.
The most common multiprocessor systems use symmetric multiprocess-
ing (SMP), in which each peer CPU processor performs all tasks, including
operating-system functions and user processes. Figure 1.8 illustrates a typical
SMP architecture with two processors, each with its own CPU. Notice that each
CPU processor has its own set of registers, as well as a private—or local—
cache. However, all processors share physical memory over the system bus.
The benefit of this model is that many processes can run simultaneously
—N processes can run if there are N CPUs—without causing performance
to deteriorate significantly. However, since the CPUs are separate, one may
be sitting idle while another is overloaded, resulting in inefficiencies. These
inefficiencies can be avoided if the processors share certain data structures. A
multiprocessor system of this form will allow processes and resources—such
as memory—to be shared dynamically among the various processors and can
lower the workload variance among the processors. Such a system must be
written carefully, as we shall see in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.
The definition of multiprocessor has evolved over time and now includes
multicore systems, in which multiple computing cores reside on a single chip.
Multicore systems can be more efficient than multiple chips with single cores
because on-chip communication is faster than between-chip communication.

In addition, one chip with multiple cores uses significantly less power than
multiple single-core chips, an important issue for mobile devices as well as
laptops.
In Figure 1.9, we show a dual-core design with two cores on the same pro-
cessor chip. In this design, each core has its own register set, as well as its own
local cache, often known as a level 1, or L1, cache. Notice, too, that a level 2 (L2)
cache is local to the chip but is shared by the two processing cores. Most archi-
tectures adopt this approach, combining local and shared caches, where local,
lower-level caches are generally smaller and faster than higher-level shared

Introduction
DEFINITIONS OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COMPONENTS
• CPU—The hardware that executes instructions.
• Processor—A physical chip that contains one or more CPUs.
• Core—The basic computation unit of the CPU.
• Multicore—Including multiple computing cores on the same CPU.
• Multiprocessor—Including multiple processors.
Although virtually all systems are now multicore, we use the general term
CPU when referring to a single computational unit of a computer system and
core as well as multicore when specifically referring to one or more cores on
a CPU.
caches. Aside from architectural considerations, such as cache, memory, and
bus contention, a multicore processor with N cores appears to the operating sys-
tem as N standard CPUs. This characteristic puts pressure on operating-system
designers—and application programmers—to make efficient use of these pro-
cessing cores, an issue we pursue in Chapter 4. Virtually all modern operating
systems—including Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as Android and iOS
mobile systems—support multicore SMP systems.
Adding additional CPUs to a multiprocessor system will increase comput-
ing power; however, as suggested earlier, the concept does not scale very well,
and once we add too many CPUs, contention for the system bus becomes a
bottleneck and performance begins to degrade. An alternative approach is
instead to provide each CPU (or group of CPUs) with its own local memory
that is accessed via a small, fast local bus. The CPUs are connected by a shared
system interconnect, so that all CPUs share one physical address space. This
approach—known as non-uniform memory access, or NUMA—is illustrated
in Figure 1.10. The advantage is that, when a CPU accesses its local memory,
not only is it fast, but there is also no contention over the system interconnect.
Thus, NUMA systems can scale more effectively as more processors are added.
Apotential drawback with a NUMAsystem is increased latency when a CPU
must access remote memory across the system interconnect, creating a possible
performance penalty. In other words, for example, CPU0 cannot access the local
memory of CPU3 as quickly as it can access its own local memory, slowing down
performance. Operating systems can minimize this NUMA penalty through
careful CPU scheduling and memory management, as discussed in Section 5.5.2
and Section 10.5.4. Because NUMA systems can scale to accommodate a large
number of processors, they are becoming increasingly popular on servers as
well as high-performance computing systems.
Finally, blade servers are systems in which multiple processor boards, I/O
boards, and networking boards are placed in the same chassis. The differ-
ence between these and traditional multiprocessor systems is that each blade-
processor board boots independently and runs its own operating system. Some
blade-server boards are multiprocessor as well, which blurs the lines between

types of computers. In essence, these servers consist of multiple independent
multiprocessor systems.
Clustered Systems
Another type of multiprocessor system is a clustered system, which gath-
ers together multiple CPUs. Clustered systems differ from the multiprocessor
systems described in Section 1.3.2 in that they are composed of two or more
individual systems—or nodes—joined together; each node is typically a mul-
ticore system. Such systems are considered loosely coupled. We should note
that the definition of clustered is not concrete; many commercial and open-
source packages wrestle to define what a clustered system is and why one
form is better than another. The generally accepted definition is that clustered
computers share storage and are closely linked via a local-area network LAN
(as described in Chapter 19) or a faster interconnect, such as InfiniBand.
Clustering is usually used to provide high-availability service—that is,
service that will continue even if one or more systems in the cluster fail.
Generally, we obtain high availability by adding a level of redundancy in the
system. A layer of cluster software runs on the cluster nodes. Each node can
monitor one or more of the others (over the network). If the monitored machine
fails, the monitoring machine can take ownership of its storage and restart the
applications that were running on the failed machine. The users and clients of
the applications see only a brief interruption of service.
High availability provides increased reliability, which is crucial in many
applications. The ability to continue providing service proportional to the level
of surviving hardware is called graceful degradation. Some systems go beyond
graceful degradation and are called fault tolerant, because they can suffer a
failure of any single component and still continue operation. Fault tolerance
requires a mechanism to allow the failure to be detected, diagnosed, and, if
possible, corrected.
Clustering can be structured asymmetrically or symmetrically. In asym-
metric clustering, one machine is in hot-standby mode while the other is run-
ning the applications. The hot-standby host machine does nothing but monitor
the active server. If that server fails, the hot-standby host becomes the active
Introduction
PC MOTHERBOARD
Consider the desktop PC motherboard with a processor socket shown below:
This board is a fully functioning computer, once its slots are populated.
It consists of a processor socket containing a CPU, DRAM sockets, PCIe bus
slots, and I/O connectors of various types. Even the lowest-cost general-
purpose CPU contains multiple cores. Some motherboards contain multiple
processor sockets. More advanced computers allow more than one system
board, creating NUMA systems.
server. In symmetric clustering, two or more hosts are running applications
and are monitoring each other. This structure is obviously more efficient, as it
uses all of the available hardware. However, it does require that more than one
application be available to run.
Since a cluster consists of several computer systems connected via a net-
work, clusters can also be used to provide high-performance computing envi-
ronments. Such systems can supply significantly greater computational power
than single-processor or even SMP systems because they can run an application
concurrently on all computers in the cluster. The application must have been
written specifically to take advantage of the cluster, however. This involves a
technique known as parallelization, which divides a program into separate
components that run in parallel on individual cores in a computer or comput-
ers in a cluster. Typically, these applications are designed so that once each
computing node in the cluster has solved its portion of the problem, the results
from all the nodes are combined into a final solution.
Other forms of clusters include parallel clusters and clustering over a
wide-area network (WAN) (as described in Chapter 19). Parallel clusters allow
multiple hosts to access the same data on shared storage. Because most oper-

ating systems lack support for simultaneous data access by multiple hosts,
parallel clusters usually require the use of special versions of software and
special releases of applications. For example, Oracle Real Application Cluster
is a version of Oracle’s database that has been designed to run on a parallel
cluster. Each machine runs Oracle, and a layer of software tracks access to the
shared disk. Each machine has full access to all data in the database. To provide
this shared access, the system must also supply access control and locking to
ensure that no conflicting operations occur. This function, commonly known
as a distributed lock manager (DLM), is included in some cluster technology.
Cluster technology is changing rapidly. Some cluster products support
thousands of systems in a cluster, as well as clustered nodes that are separated
by miles. Many of these improvements are made possible by storage-area
networks (SANs), as described in Section 11.7.4, which allow many systems
to attach to a pool of storage. If the applications and their data are stored on
the SAN, then the cluster software can assign the application to run on any
host that is attached to the SAN. If the host fails, then any other host can take
over. In a database cluster, dozens of hosts can share the same database, greatly
increasing performance and reliability. Figure 1.11 depicts the general structure
of a clustered system.


## 1.4 Operating-System Operations
> id: ch01-1-4 | src: book 1.4 | kind: concept

Now that we have discussed basic information about computer-system organi-
zation and architecture, we are ready to talk about operating systems. An oper-
ating system provides the environment within which programs are executed.
Internally, operating systems vary greatly, since they are organized along many
different lines. There are, however, many commonalities, which we consider in
this section.
For a computer to start running—for instance, when it is powered up
or rebooted—it needs to have an initial program to run. As noted earlier,
this initial program, or bootstrap program, tends to be simple. Typically, it is
stored within the computer hardware in firmware. It initializes all aspects of
the system, from CPU registers to device controllers to memory contents. The
bootstrap program must know how to load the operating system and how to
Introduction
HADOOP
Hadoop is an open-source software framework that is used for distributed
processing of large data sets (known as big data) in a clustered system con-
taining simple, low-cost hardware components. Hadoop is designed to scale
from a single system to a cluster containing thousands of computing nodes.
Tasks are assigned to a node in the cluster, and Hadoop arranges communica-
tion between nodes to manage parallel computations to process and coalesce
results. Hadoop also detects and manages failures in nodes, providing an
efficient and highly reliable distributed computing service.
Hadoop is organized around the following three components:
1.
A distributed file system that manages data and files across distributed com-
puting nodes.
2.
The YARN (“Yet Another Resource Negotiator”) framework, which manages
resources within the cluster as well as scheduling tasks on nodes in the
cluster.
3.
The MapReduce system, which allows parallel processing of data across
nodes in the cluster.
Hadoop is designed to run on Linux systems, and Hadoop applications
can be written using several programming languages, including scripting
languages such as PHP, Perl, and Python. Java is a popular choice for
developing Hadoop applications, as Hadoop has several Java libraries that
support MapReduce. More information on MapReduce and Hadoop can
be found at https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred tutorial.html
and https://hadoop.apache.org
start executing that system. To accomplish this goal, the bootstrap program
must locate the operating-system kernel and load it into memory.
Once the kernel is loaded and executing, it can start providing services to
the system and its users. Some services are provided outside of the kernel by
system programs that are loaded into memory at boot time to become system
daemons, which run the entire time the kernel is running. On Linux, the first
system program is “systemd,” and it starts many other daemons. Once this
phase is complete, the system is fully booted, and the system waits for some
event to occur.
If there are no processes to execute, no I/O devices to service, and no users
to whom to respond, an operating system will sit quietly, waiting for something
to happen. Events are almost always signaled by the occurrence of an interrupt.
In Section 1.2.1 we described hardware interrupts. Another form of interrupt is
a trap (or an exception), which is a software-generated interrupt caused either
by an error (for example, division by zero or invalid memory access) or by
a specific request from a user program that an operating-system service be
performed by executing a special operation called a system call.


## 1.4 Operating-System Operations
> id: ch01-1-4 | src: book 1.4 | kind: concept

Multiprogramming and Multitasking
One of the most important aspects of operating systems is the ability to run
multiple programs, as a single program cannot, in general, keep either the CPU
or the I/O devices busy at all times. Furthermore, users typically want to run
more than one program at a time as well. Multiprogramming increases CPU
utilization, as well as keeping users satisfied, by organizing programs so that
the CPU always has one to execute. In a multiprogrammed system, a program
in execution is termed a process.
The idea is as follows: The operating system keeps several processes in
memory simultaneously (Figure 1.12). The operating system picks and begins
to execute one of these processes. Eventually, the process may have to wait for
some task, such as an I/O operation, to complete. In a non-multiprogrammed
system, the CPU would sit idle. In a multiprogrammed system, the operating
system simply switches to, and executes, another process. When that process
needs to wait, the CPU switches to another process, and so on. Eventually, the
first process finishes waiting and gets the CPU back. As long as at least one
process needs to execute, the CPU is never idle.
This idea is common in other life situations. A lawyer does not work for
only one client at a time, for example. While one case is waiting to go to trial
or have papers typed, the lawyer can work on another case. If she has enough
clients, the lawyer will never be idle for lack of work. (Idle lawyers tend to
become politicians, so there is a certain social value in keeping lawyers busy.)
Multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming. In multitasking
systems, the CPU executes multiple processes by switching among them, but
the switches occur frequently, providing the user with a fast response time.
Consider that when a process executes, it typically executes for only a short
time before it either finishes or needs to perform I/O. I/O may be interactive;
that is, output goes to a display for the user, and input comes from a user
keyboard, mouse, or touch screen. Since interactive I/O typically runs at “peo-
ple speeds,” it may take a long time to complete. Input, for example, may be

Introduction
bounded by the user’s typing speed; seven characters per second is fast for
people but incredibly slow for computers. Rather than let the CPU sit idle as
this interactive input takes place, the operating system will rapidly switch the
CPU to another process.
Having several processes in memory at the same time requires some form
of memory management, which we cover in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10. In
addition, if several processes are ready to run at the same time, the system must
choose which process will run next. Making this decision is CPU scheduling,
which is discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, running multiple processes concur-
rently requires that their ability to affect one another be limited in all phases of
the operating system, including process scheduling, disk storage, and memory
management. We discuss these considerations throughout the text.
In a multitasking system, the operating system must ensure reasonable
response time. A common method for doing so is virtual memory, a tech-
nique that allows the execution of a process that is not completely in memory
(Chapter 10). The main advantage of this scheme is that it enables users to
run programs that are larger than actual physical memory. Further, it abstracts
main memory into a large, uniform array of storage, separating logical mem-
ory as viewed by the user from physical memory. This arrangement frees
programmers from concern over memory-storage limitations.
Multiprogramming and multitasking systems must also provide a file sys-
tem (Chapter 13, Chapter 14, and Chapter 15). The file system resides on a
secondary storage; hence, storage management must be provided (Chapter 11).
In addition, a system must protect resources from inappropriate use (Chapter
17). To ensure orderly execution, the system must also provide mechanisms for
process synchronization and communication (Chapter 6 and Chapter 7), and it
may ensure that processes do not get stuck in a deadlock, forever waiting for
one another (Chapter 8).
Dual-Mode and Multimode Operation
Since the operating system and its users share the hardware and software
resources of the computer system, a properly designed operating system must
ensure that an incorrect (or malicious) program cannot cause other programs
—or the operating system itself—to execute incorrectly. In order to ensure
the proper execution of the system, we must be able to distinguish between
the execution of operating-system code and user-defined code. The approach
taken by most computer systems is to provide hardware support that allows
differentiation among various modes of execution.
At the very least, we need two separate modes of operation: user mode
and kernel mode (also called supervisor mode, system mode, or privileged
mode). A bit, called the mode bit, is added to the hardware of the computer
to indicate the current mode: kernel (0) or user (1). With the mode bit, we can
distinguish between a task that is executed on behalf of the operating system
and one that is executed on behalf of the user. When the computer system is
executing on behalf of a user application, the system is in user mode. However,
when a user application requests a service from the operating system (via a
system call), the system must transition from user to kernel mode to fulfill

the request. This is shown in Figure 1.13. As we shall see, this architectural
enhancement is useful for many other aspects of system operation as well.
At system boot time, the hardware starts in kernel mode. The operating
system is then loaded and starts user applications in user mode. Whenever a
trap or interrupt occurs, the hardware switches from user mode to kernel mode
(that is, changes the state of the mode bit to 0). Thus, whenever the operating
system gains control of the computer, it is in kernel mode. The system always
switches to user mode (by setting the mode bit to 1) before passing control to
a user program.
The dual mode of operation provides us with the means for protecting the
operating system from errant users—and errant users from one another. We
accomplish this protection by designating some of the machine instructions
that may cause harm as privileged instructions. The hardware allows privi-
leged instructions to be executed only in kernel mode. If an attempt is made to
execute a privileged instruction in user mode, the hardware does not execute
the instruction but rather treats it as illegal and traps it to the operating system.
The instruction to switch to kernel mode is an example of a privileged
instruction. Some other examples include I/O control, timer management, and
interrupt management. Many additional privileged instructions are discussed
throughout the text.
The concept of modes can be extended beyond two modes. For example,
Intel processors have four separate protection rings, where ring 0 is kernel
mode and ring 3 is user mode. (Although rings 1 and 2 could be used for vari-
ous operating-system services, in practice they are rarely used.) ARMv8 systems
have seven modes. CPUs that support virtualization (Section 18.1) frequently
have a separate mode to indicate when the virtual machine manager (VMM) is
in control of the system. In this mode, the VMM has more privileges than user
processes but fewer than the kernel. It needs that level of privilege so it can
create and manage virtual machines, changing the CPU state to do so.
We can now better understand the life cycle of instruction execution in a
computer system. Initial control resides in the operating system, where instruc-
tions are executed in kernel mode. When control is given to a user applica-
tion, the mode is set to user mode. Eventually, control is switched back to
the operating system via an interrupt, a trap, or a system call. Most contem-
porary operating systems—such as Microsoft Windows, Unix, and Linux—
Introduction
take advantage of this dual-mode feature and provide greater protection for
the operating system.
System calls provide the means for a user program to ask the operating
system to perform tasks reserved for the operating system on the user pro-
gram’s behalf. A system call is invoked in a variety of ways, depending on
the functionality provided by the underlying processor. In all forms, it is the
method used by a process to request action by the operating system. A system
call usually takes the form of a trap to a specific location in the interrupt vector.
This trap can be executed by a generic trap instruction, although some systems
have a specific syscall instruction to invoke a system call.
When a system call is executed, it is typically treated by the hardware as
a software interrupt. Control passes through the interrupt vector to a service
routine in the operating system, and the mode bit is set to kernel mode. The
system-call service routine is a part of the operating system. The kernel exam-
ines the interrupting instruction to determine what system call has occurred;
a parameter indicates what type of service the user program is requesting.
Additional information needed for the request may be passed in registers, on
the stack, or in memory (with pointers to the memory locations passed in reg-
isters). The kernel verifies that the parameters are correct and legal, executes
the request, and returns control to the instruction following the system call. We
describe system calls more fully in Section 2.3.
Once hardware protection is in place, it detects errors that violate modes.
These errors are normally handled by the operating system. If a user program
fails in some way—such as by making an attempt either to execute an illegal
instruction or to access memory that is not in the user’s address space—then
the hardware traps to the operating system. The trap transfers control through
the interrupt vector to the operating system, just as an interrupt does. When
a program error occurs, the operating system must terminate the program
abnormally. This situation is handled by the same code as a user-requested
abnormal termination. An appropriate error message is given, and the memory
of the program may be dumped. The memory dump is usually written to a file
so that the user or programmer can examine it and perhaps correct it and restart
the program.
Timer
We must ensure that the operating system maintains control over the CPU.
We cannot allow a user program to get stuck in an infinite loop or to fail
to call system services and never return control to the operating system. To
accomplish this goal, we can use a timer. A timer can be set to interrupt
the computer after a specified period. The period may be fixed (for example,
1/60 second) or variable (for example, from 1 millisecond to 1 second). A
variable timer is generally implemented by a fixed-rate clock and a counter.
The operating system sets the counter. Every time the clock ticks, the counter
is decremented. When the counter reaches 0, an interrupt occurs. For instance,
a 10-bit counter with a 1-millisecond clock allows interrupts at intervals from
1 millisecond to 1,024 milliseconds, in steps of 1 millisecond.
Before turning over control to the user, the operating system ensures that
the timer is set to interrupt. If the timer interrupts, control transfers automati-
cally to the operating system, which may treat the interrupt as a fatal error or

LINUX TIMERS
On Linux systems, the kernel configuration parameter HZ specifies the fre-
quency of timer interrupts. An HZ value of 250 means that the timer generates
250 interrupts per second, or one interrupt every 4 milliseconds. The value
of HZ depends upon how the kernel is configured, as well the machine type
and architecture on which it is running. A related kernel variable is jiffies,
which represent the number of timer interrupts that have occurred since the
system was booted. A programming project in Chapter 2 further explores
timing in the Linux kernel.
may give the program more time. Clearly, instructions that modify the content
of the timer are privileged.


## 1.5 Resource Management
> id: ch01-1-5 | src: book 1.5 | kind: concept

As we have seen, an operating system is a resource manager. The system’s CPU,
memory space, file-storage space, and I/O devices are among the resources that
the operating system must manage.
Process Management
A program can do nothing unless its instructions are executed by a CPU. A
program in execution, as mentioned, is a process. Aprogram such as a compiler
is a process, and a word-processing program being run by an individual user
on a PC is a process. Similarly, a social media app on a mobile device is a
process. For now, you can consider a process to be an instance of a program in
execution, but later you will see that the concept is more general. As described
in Chapter 3, it is possible to provide system calls that allow processes to create
subprocesses to execute concurrently.
Aprocess needs certain resources—including CPU time, memory, files, and
I/O devices—to accomplish its task. These resources are typically allocated to
the process while it is running. In addition to the various physical and logical
resources that a process obtains when it is created, various initialization data
(input) may be passed along. For example, consider a process running a web
browser whose function is to display the contents of a web page on a screen.
The process will be given the URL as an input and will execute the appropriate
instructions and system calls to obtain and display the desired information on
the screen. When the process terminates, the operating system will reclaim any
reusable resources.
We emphasize that a program by itself is not a process. A program is a
passive entity, like the contents of a file stored on disk, whereas a process is an
active entity. A single-threaded process has one program counter specifying
the next instruction to execute. (Threads are covered in Chapter 4.) The exe-
cution of such a process must be sequential. The CPU executes one instruction
of the process after another, until the process completes. Further, at any time,
one instruction at most is executed on behalf of the process. Thus, although
Introduction
two processes may be associated with the same program, they are nevertheless
considered two separate execution sequences. A multithreaded process has
multiple program counters, each pointing to the next instruction to execute
for a given thread.
A process is the unit of work in a system. A system consists of a collec-
tion of processes, some of which are operating-system processes (those that
execute system code) and the rest of which are user processes (those that exe-
cute user code). All these processes can potentially execute concurrently—by
multiplexing on a single CPU core—or in parallel across multiple CPU cores.
The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connec-
tion with process management:
• Creating and deleting both user and system processes
• Scheduling processes and threads on the CPUs
• Suspending and resuming processes
• Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
• Providing mechanisms for process communication
We discuss process-management techniques in Chapter 3 through Chapter 7.
Memory Management
As discussed in Section 1.2.2, the main memory is central to the operation of a
modern computer system. Main memory is a large array of bytes, ranging in
size from hundreds of thousands to billions. Each byte has its own address.
Main memory is a repository of quickly accessible data shared by the CPU
and I/O devices. The CPU reads instructions from main memory during the
instruction-fetch cycle and both reads and writes data from main memory
during the data-fetch cycle (on a von Neumann architecture). As noted earlier,
the main memory is generally the only large storage device that the CPU is able
to address and access directly. For example, for the CPU to process data from
disk, those data must first be transferred to main memory by CPU-generated
I/O calls. In the same way, instructions must be in memory for the CPU to
execute them.
For a program to be executed, it must be mapped to absolute addresses and
loaded into memory. As the program executes, it accesses program instructions
and data from memory by generating these absolute addresses. Eventually,
the program terminates, its memory space is declared available, and the next
program can be loaded and executed.
To improve both the utilization of the CPU and the speed of the computer’s
response to its users, general-purpose computers must keep several programs
in memory, creating a need for memory management. Many different memory-
management schemes are used. These schemes reflect various approaches, and
the effectiveness of any given algorithm depends on the situation. In selecting a
memory-management scheme for a specific system, we must take into account
many factors—especially the hardware design of the system. Each algorithm
requires its own hardware support.

• Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed
• Deciding which processes (or parts of processes) and data to move into
and out of memory
Memory-management techniques are discussed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.
File-System Management
To make the computer system convenient for users, the operating system
provides a uniform, logical view of information storage. The operating system
abstracts from the physical properties of its storage devices to define a logical
storage unit, the fil . The operating system maps files onto physical media and
accesses these files via the storage devices.
File management is one of the most visible components of an operating
system. Computers can store information on several different types of physi-
cal media. Secondary storage is the most common, but tertiary storage is also
possible. Each of these media has its own characteristics and physical orga-
nization. Most are controlled by a device, such as a disk drive, that also has
its own unique characteristics. These properties include access speed, capacity,
data-transfer rate, and access method (sequential or random).
A file is a collection of related information defined by its creator. Com-
monly, files represent programs (both source and object forms) and data. Data
files may be numeric, alphabetic, alphanumeric, or binary. Files may be free-
form (for example, text files), or they may be formatted rigidly (for example,
fixed fields such as an mp3 music file). Clearly, the concept of a file is an
extremely general one.
The operating system implements the abstract concept of a file by manag-
ing mass storage media and the devices that control them. In addition, files are
normally organized into directories to make them easier to use. Finally, when
multiple users have access to files, it may be desirable to control which user
may access a file and how that user may access it (for example, read, write,
append).
The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connec-
tion with file management:
• Creating and deleting files
• Creating and deleting directories to organize files
• Supporting primitives for manipulating files and directories
• Mapping files onto mass storage
• Backing up files on stable (nonvolatile) storage media
Introduction
File-management techniques are discussed in Chapter 13, Chapter 14, and
Mass-Storage Management
As we have already seen, the computer system must provide secondary storage
to back up main memory. Most modern computer systems use HDDs and NVM
devices as the principal on-line storage media for both programs and data.
Most programs—including compilers, web browsers, word processors, and
games—are stored on these devices until loaded into memory. The programs
then use the devices as both the source and the destination of their processing.
Hence, the proper management of secondary storage is of central importance
to a computer system. The operating system is responsible for the following
activities in connection with secondary storage management:
• Mounting and unmounting
• Free-space management
• Storage allocation
• Disk scheduling
• Partitioning
• Protection
Because secondary storage is used frequently and extensively, it must be used
efficiently. The entire speed of operation of a computer may hinge on the speeds
of the secondary storage subsystem and the algorithms that manipulate that
subsystem.
At the same time, there are many uses for storage that is slower and lower
in cost (and sometimes higher in capacity) than secondary storage. Backups
of disk data, storage of seldom-used data, and long-term archival storage are
some examples. Magnetic tape drives and their tapes and CD DVD and Blu-ray
drives and platters are typical tertiary storage devices.
Tertiary storage is not crucial to system performance, but it still must
be managed. Some operating systems take on this task, while others leave
tertiary-storage management to application programs. Some of the functions
that operating systems can provide include mounting and unmounting media
in devices, allocating and freeing the devices for exclusive use by processes,
and migrating data from secondary to tertiary storage.
Techniques for secondary storage and tertiary storage management are
Cache Management
Caching is an important principle of computer systems. Here’s how it works.
Information is normally kept in some storage system (such as main memory).
As it is used, it is copied into a faster storage system—the cache—on a tem-
porary basis. When we need a particular piece of information, we first check
whether it is in the cache. If it is, we use the information directly from the cache.

Characteristics of various types of storage.
If it is not, we use the information from the source, putting a copy in the cache
under the assumption that we will need it again soon.
In addition, internal programmable registers provide a high-speed cache
for main memory. The programmer (or compiler) implements the register-
allocation and register-replacement algorithms to decide which information to
keep in registers and which to keep in main memory.
Other caches are implemented totally in hardware. For instance, most
systems have an instruction cache to hold the instructions expected to be
executed next. Without this cache, the CPU would have to wait several cycles
while an instruction was fetched from main memory. For similar reasons, most
systems have one or more high-speed data caches in the memory hierarchy. We
are not concerned with these hardware-only caches in this text, since they are
outside the control of the operating system.
Because caches have limited size, cache management is an important
design problem. Careful selection of the cache size and of a replacement policy
can result in greatly increased performance, as you can see by examining Figure
1.14. Replacement algorithms for software-controlled caches are discussed in
The movement of information between levels of a storage hierarchy may be
either explicit or implicit, depending on the hardware design and the control-
ling operating-system software. For instance, data transfer from cache to CPU
and registers is usually a hardware function, with no operating-system inter-
vention. In contrast, transfer of data from disk to memory is usually controlled
by the operating system.
In a hierarchical storage structure, the same data may appear in different
levels of the storage system. For example, suppose that an integer A that is
to be incremented by 1 is located in file B, and file B resides on hard disk.
The increment operation proceeds by first issuing an I/O operation to copy the
disk block on which A resides to main memory. This operation is followed by
copying A to the cache and to an internal register. Thus, the copy of A appears
in several places: on the hard disk, in main memory, in the cache, and in an
internal register (see Figure 1.15). Once the increment takes place in the internal
register, the value of A differs in the various storage systems. The value of A

becomes the same only after the new value of A is written from the internal
register back to the hard disk.
In a computing environment where only one process executes at a time,
this arrangement poses no difficulties, since an access to integer A will always
be to the copy at the highest level of the hierarchy. However, in a multitasking
environment, where the CPU is switched back and forth among various pro-
cesses, extreme care must be taken to ensure that, if several processes wish to
access A, then each of these processes will obtain the most recently updated
value of A.
The situation becomes more complicated in a multiprocessor environment
where, in addition to maintaining internal registers, each of the CPUs also
contains a local cache (refer back to Figure 1.8). In such an environment, a copy
of A may exist simultaneously in several caches. Since the various CPUs can
all execute in parallel, we must make sure that an update to the value of A
in one cache is immediately reflected in all other caches where A resides. This
situation is called cache coherency, and it is usually a hardware issue (handled
below the operating-system level).
In a distributed environment, the situation becomes even more complex.
In this environment, several copies (or replicas) of the same file can be kept on
different computers. Since the various replicas may be accessed and updated
concurrently, some distributed systems ensure that, when a replica is updated
in one place, all other replicas are brought up to date as soon as possible. There
are various ways to achieve this guarantee, as we discuss in Chapter 19.
I/O System Management
One of the purposes of an operating system is to hide the peculiarities of
specific hardware devices from the user. For example, in UNIX, the peculiarities
of I/O devices are hidden from the bulk of the operating system itself by the
I/O subsystem. The I/O subsystem consists of several components:
• A memory-management component that includes buffering, caching, and
spooling
• A general device-driver interface
• Drivers for specific hardware devices
Only the device driver knows the peculiarities of the specific device to which
it is assigned.
We discussed earlier in this chapter how interrupt handlers and device
drivers are used in the construction of efficient I/O subsystems. In Chapter 12,
we discuss how the I/O subsystem interfaces to the other system components,
manages devices, transfers data, and detects I/O completion.

## 1.6 Security and Protection
> id: ch01-1-6 | src: book 1.6 | kind: concept

If a computer system has multiple users and allows the concurrent execution
of multiple processes, then access to data must be regulated. For that purpose,
mechanisms ensure that files, memory segments, CPU, and other resources can
be operated on by only those processes that have gained proper authoriza-
tion from the operating system. For example, memory-addressing hardware
ensures that a process can execute only within its own address space. The
timer ensures that no process can gain control of the CPU without eventually
relinquishing control. Device-control registers are not accessible to users, so the
integrity of the various peripheral devices is protected.
Protection, then, is any mechanism for controlling the access of processes
or users to the resources defined by a computer system. This mechanism must
provide means to specify the controls to be imposed and to enforce the controls.
Protection can improve reliability by detecting latent errors at the interfaces
between component subsystems. Early detection of interface errors can often
prevent contamination of a healthy subsystem by another subsystem that is
malfunctioning. Furthermore, an unprotected resource cannot defend against
use (or misuse) by an unauthorized or incompetent user. A protection-oriented
system provides a means to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized
A system can have adequate protection but still be prone to failure and
allow inappropriate access. Consider a user whose authentication information
(her means of identifying herself to the system) is stolen. Her data could be
copied or deleted, even though file and memory protection are working. It is
the job of security to defend a system from external and internal attacks. Such
attacks spread across a huge range and include viruses and worms, denial-of-
service attacks (which use all of a system’s resources and so keep legitimate
users out of the system), identity theft, and theft of service (unauthorized use
of a system). Prevention of some of these attacks is considered an operating-
system function on some systems, while other systems leave it to policy or
additional software. Due to the alarming rise in security incidents, operating-
system security features are a fast-growing area of research and implementa-
tion. We discuss security in Chapter 16.
Protection and security require the system to be able to distinguish among
all its users. Most operating systems maintain a list of user names and asso-
ciated user identifier (user IDs). In Windows parlance, this is a security ID
(SID). These numerical IDs are unique, one per user. When a user logs in to
the system, the authentication stage determines the appropriate user ID for the
user. That user ID is associated with all of the user’s processes and threads.
When an ID needs to be readable by a user, it is translated back to the user
name via the user name list.
In some circumstances, we wish to distinguish among sets of users rather
than individual users. For example, the owner of a file on a UNIX system may be
allowed to issue all operations on that file, whereas a selected set of users may
be allowed only to read the file. To accomplish this, we need to define a group
name and the set of users belonging to that group. Group functionality can
be implemented as a system-wide list of group names and group identifier .
A user can be in one or more groups, depending on operating-system design
Introduction
decisions. The user’s group IDs are also included in every associated process
and thread.
In the course of normal system use, the user ID and group ID for a user
are sufficient. However, a user sometimes needs to escalate privileges to gain
extra permissions for an activity. The user may need access to a device that is
restricted, for example. Operating systems provide various methods to allow
privilege escalation. On UNIX, for instance, the setuid attribute on a program
causes that program to run with the user ID of the owner of the file, rather than
the current user’s ID. The process runs with this effective UID until it turns off
the extra privileges or terminates.


## 1.7 Virtualization
> id: ch01-1-7 | src: book 1.7 | kind: concept

Virtualization is a technology that allows us to abstract the hardware of a sin-
gle computer (the CPU, memory, disk drives, network interface cards, and so
forth) into several different execution environments, thereby creating the illu-
sion that each separate environment is running on its own private computer.
These environments can be viewed as different individual operating systems
(for example, Windows and UNIX) that may be running at the same time and
may interact with each other. A user of a virtual machine can switch among
the various operating systems in the same way a user can switch among the
various processes running concurrently in a single operating system.
Virtualization allows operating systems to run as applications within other
operating systems. At first blush, there seems to be little reason for such func-
tionality. But the virtualization industry is vast and growing, which is a testa-
ment to its utility and importance.
Broadly speaking, virtualization software is one member of a class that also
includes emulation. Emulation, which involves simulating computer hard-
ware in software, is typically used when the source CPU type is different from
the target CPU type. For example, when Apple switched from the IBM Power
CPU to the Intel x86 CPU for its desktop and laptop computers, it included an
emulation facility called “Rosetta,” which allowed applications compiled for
the IBM CPU to run on the Intel CPU. That same concept can be extended to allow
an entire operating system written for one platform to run on another. Emula-
tion comes at a heavy price, however. Every machine-level instruction that runs
natively on the source system must be translated to the equivalent function
on the target system, frequently resulting in several target instructions. If the
source and target CPUs have similar performance levels, the emulated code
may run much more slowly than the native code.
With virtualization, in contrast, an operating system that is natively com-
piled for a particular CPU architecture runs within another operating system
also native to that CPU. Virtualization first came about on IBM mainframes as
a method for multiple users to run tasks concurrently. Running multiple vir-
tual machines allowed (and still allows) many users to run tasks on a system
designed for a single user. Later, in response to problems with running multiple
Microsoft Windows applications on the Intel x86 CPU, VMware created a new
virtualization technology in the form of an application that ran on Windows.
That application ran one or more guest copies of Windows or other native
x86 operating systems, each running its own applications. (See Figure 1.16.)

Windows was the host operating system, and the VMware application was the
virtual machine manager (VMM). The VMM runs the guest operating systems,
manages their resource use, and protects each guest from the others.
Even though modern operating systems are fully capable of running multi-
ple applications reliably, the use of virtualization continues to grow. On laptops
and desktops, a VMM allows the user to install multiple operating systems for
exploration or to run applications written for operating systems other than the
native host. For example, an Apple laptop running macOS on the x86 CPU can
run a Windows 10 guest to allow execution of Windows applications. Com-
panies writing software for multiple operating systems can use virtualization
to run all of those operating systems on a single physical server for develop-
ment, testing, and debugging. Within data centers, virtualization has become a
common method of executing and managing computing environments. VMMs
like VMware ESXand Citrix XenServer no longer run on host operating systems
but rather are the host operating systems, providing services and resource
management to virtual machine processes.
With this text, we provide a Linux virtual machine that allows you to
run Linux—as well as the development tools we provide—on your personal
system regardless of your host operating system. Full details of the features
and implementation of virtualization can be found in Chapter 18.


## 1.8 Distributed Systems
> id: ch01-1-8 | src: book 1.8 | kind: concept

A distributed system is a collection of physically separate, possibly heteroge-
neous computer systems that are networked to provide users with access to
the various resources that the system maintains. Access to a shared resource
increases computation speed, functionality, data availability, and reliability.
Some operating systems generalize network access as a form of file access, with
the details of networking contained in the network interface’s device driver.
Introduction
Others make users specifically invoke network functions. Generally, systems
contain a mix of the two modes—for example FTP and NFS. The protocols
that create a distributed system can greatly affect that system’s utility and
popularity.
A network, in the simplest terms, is a communication path between two or
more systems. Distributed systems depend on networking for their functional-
ity. Networks vary by the protocols used, the distances between nodes, and the
transport media. TCP/IP is the most common network protocol, and it provides
the fundamental architecture of the Internet. Most operating systems support
TCP/IP, including all general-purpose ones. Some systems support proprietary
protocols to suit their needs. For an operating system, it is necessary only that
a network protocol have an interface device—a network adapter, for example
—with a device driver to manage it, as well as software to handle data. These
concepts are discussed throughout this book.
Networks are characterized based on the distances between their nodes.
A local-area network (LAN) connects computers within a room, a building,
or a campus. A wide-area network (WAN) usually links buildings, cities, or
countries. Aglobal company may have a WAN to connect its offices worldwide,
for example. These networks may run one protocol or several protocols. The
continuing advent of new technologies brings about new forms of networks.
For example, a metropolitan-area network (MAN) could link buildings within
a city. BlueTooth and 802.11 devices use wireless technology to communicate
over a distance of several feet, in essence creating a personal-area network
(PAN) between a phone and a headset or a smartphone and a desktop computer.
The media to carry networks are equally varied. They include copper wires,
fiber strands, and wireless transmissions between satellites, microwave dishes,
and radios. When computing devices are connected to cellular phones, they
create a network. Even very short-range infrared communication can be used
for networking. At a rudimentary level, whenever computers communicate,
they use or create a network. These networks also vary in their performance
and reliability.
Some operating systems have taken the concept of networks and dis-
tributed systems further than the notion of providing network connectivity.
A network operating system is an operating system that provides features
such as file sharing across the network, along with a communication scheme
that allows different processes on different computers to exchange messages.
A computer running a network operating system acts autonomously from all
other computers on the network, although it is aware of the network and is
able to communicate with other networked computers. A distributed operat-
ing system provides a less autonomous environment. The different computers
communicate closely enough to provide the illusion that only a single operat-
ing system controls the network. We cover computer networks and distributed

who require further details on these structures, as well as others, should consult
the bibliography at the end of the chapter.
Lists, Stacks, and Queues
An array is a simple data structure in which each element can be accessed
directly. For example, main memory is constructed as an array. If the data item
being stored is larger than one byte, then multiple bytes can be allocated to the
item, and the item is addressed as “item number × item size.” But what about
storing an item whose size may vary? And what about removing an item if the
relative positions of the remaining items must be preserved? In such situations,
arrays give way to other data structures.
After arrays, lists are perhaps the most fundamental data structures in com-
puter science. Whereas each item in an array can be accessed directly, the items
in a list must be accessed in a particular order. That is, a list represents a collec-
tion of data values as a sequence. The most common method for implementing
this structure is a linked list, in which items are linked to one another. Linked
lists are of several types:
• In a singly linked list, each item points to its successor, as illustrated in
Figure 1.17.
• In a doubly linked list, a given item can refer either to its predecessor or to
its successor, as illustrated in Figure 1.18.
• In a circularly linked list, the last element in the list refers to the first
element, rather than to null, as illustrated in Figure 1.19.
Linked lists accommodate items of varying sizes and allow easy insertion
and deletion of items. One potential disadvantage of using a list is that per-
formance for retrieving a specified item in a list of size n is linear—O(n), as it
requires potentially traversing all n elements in the worst case. Lists are some-
times used directly by kernel algorithms. Frequently, though, they are used for
constructing more powerful data structures, such as stacks and queues.
A stack is a sequentially ordered data structure that uses the last in, first
out (LIFO) principle for adding and removing items, meaning that the last item

placed onto a stack is the first item removed. The operations for inserting and
removing items from a stack are known as push and pop, respectively. An
operating system often uses a stack when invoking function calls. Parameters,
local variables, and the return address are pushed onto the stack when a
function is called; returning from the function call pops those items off the
stack.
A queue, in contrast, is a sequentially ordered data structure that uses the
first in, first out (FIFO) principle: items are removed from a queue in the order
in which they were inserted. There are many everyday examples of queues,
including shoppers waiting in a checkout line at a store and cars waiting in line
at a traffic signal. Queues are also quite common in operating systems—jobs
that are sent to a printer are typically printed in the order in which they were
submitted, for example. As we shall see in Chapter 5, tasks that are waiting to
be run on an available CPU are often organized in queues.
Trees
A tree is a data structure that can be used to represent data hierarchically. Data
values in a tree structure are linked through parent–child relationships. In a
general tree, a parent may have an unlimited number of children. In a binary
tree, a parent may have at most two children, which we term the left child
and the right child. A binary search tree additionally requires an ordering
between the parent’s two children in which left child <= right child. Figure 1.20
provides an example of a binary search tree. When we search for an item in a
binary search tree, the worst-case performance is O(n) (consider how this can
occur). To remedy this situation, we can use an algorithm to create a balanced
binary search tree. Here, a tree containing n items has at most lg n levels, thus
ensuring worst-case performance of O(lg n). We shall see in Section 5.7.1 that
Linux uses a balanced binary search tree (known as a red-black tree) as part
its CPU-scheduling algorithm.
Hash Functions and Maps
A hash function takes data as its input, performs a numeric operation on the
data, and returns a numeric value. This numeric value can then be used as
an index into a table (typically an array) to quickly retrieve the data. Whereas
searching for a data item through a list of size n can require up to O(n) compar-
isons, using a hash function for retrieving data from a table can be as good as
O(1), depending on implementation details. Because of this performance, hash
functions are used extensively in operating systems.
One potential difficulty with hash functions is that two unique inputs
can result in the same output value—that is, they can link to the same table

location. We can accommodate this hash collision by having a linked list at the
table location that contains all of the items with the same hash value. Of course,
the more collisions there are, the less efficient the hash function is.
One use of a hash function is to implement a hash map, which associates
(or maps) [key:value] pairs using a hash function. Once the mapping is estab-
lished, we can apply the hash function to the key to obtain the value from the
hash map (Figure 1.21). For example, suppose that a user name is mapped to
a password. Password authentication then proceeds as follows: a user enters
her user name and password. The hash function is applied to the user name,
which is then used to retrieve the password. The retrieved password is then
compared with the password entered by the user for authentication.
Bitmaps
Abitmap is a string of n binary digits that can be used to represent the status of
n items. For example, suppose we have several resources, and the availability
of each resource is indicated by the value of a binary digit: 0 means that the
resource is available, while 1 indicates that it is unavailable (or vice versa). The

Introduction
LINUX KERNEL DATA STRUCTURES
The data structures used in the Linux kernel are available in the kernel source
code. The include file <linux/list.h> provides details of the linked-list
data structure used throughout the kernel. A queue in Linux is known as a
kfifo, and its implementation can be found in the kfifo.c file in the kernel
directory of the source code. Linux also provides a balanced binary search tree
implementation using red-black trees. Details can be found in the include file
<linux/rbtree.h>.
value of the ith position in the bitmap is associated with the ith resource. As an
example, consider the bitmap shown below:
0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
Resources 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 are unavailable; resources 0, 1, 3, and 7 are available.
The power of bitmaps becomes apparent when we consider their space
efficiency. If we were to use an eight-bit Boolean value instead of a single bit,
the resulting data structure would be eight times larger. Thus, bitmaps are
commonly used when there is a need to represent the availability of a large
number of resources. Disk drives provide a nice illustration. A medium-sized
disk drive might be divided into several thousand individual units, called disk
blocks. A bitmap can be used to indicate the availability of each disk block.
In summary, data structures are pervasive in operating system implemen-
tations. Thus, we will see the structures discussed here, along with others,
throughout this text as we explore kernel algorithms and their implementa-
tions.

So far, we have briefly described several aspects of computer systems and the
operating systems that manage them. We turn now to a discussion of how
operating systems are used in a variety of computing environments.
Traditional Computing
As computing has matured, the lines separating many of the traditional com-
puting environments have blurred. Consider the “typical office environment.”
Just a few years ago, this environment consisted of PCs connected to a network,
with servers providing file and print services. Remote access was awkward,
and portability was achieved by use of laptop computers.
Today, web technologies and increasing WAN bandwidth are stretching the
boundaries of traditional computing. Companies establish portals, which pro-
vide web accessibility to their internal servers. Network computers (or thin
clients)—which are essentially terminals that understand web-based comput-
ing—are used in place of traditional workstations where more security or
easier maintenance is desired. Mobile computers can synchronize with PCs
to allow very portable use of company information. Mobile devices can also
Computing Environments
connect to wireless networks and cellular data networks to use the company’s
web portal (as well as the myriad other web resources).
At home, most users once had a single computer with a slow modem con-
nection to the office, the Internet, or both. Today, network-connection speeds
once available only at great cost are relatively inexpensive in many places,
giving home users more access to more data. These fast data connections are
allowing home computers to serve up web pages and to run networks that
include printers, client PCs, and servers. Many homes use firewall to pro-
tect their networks from security breaches. Firewalls limit the communications
between devices on a network.
In the latter half of the 20th century, computing resources were relatively
scarce. (Before that, they were nonexistent!) For a period of time, systems were
either batch or interactive. Batch systems processed jobs in bulk, with prede-
termined input from files or other data sources. Interactive systems waited for
input from users. To optimize the use of the computing resources, multiple
users shared time on these systems. These time-sharing systems used a timer
and scheduling algorithms to cycle processes rapidly through the CPU, giving
each user a share of the resources.
Traditional time-sharing systems are rare today. The same scheduling tech-
nique is still in use on desktop computers, laptops, servers, and even mobile
computers, but frequently all the processes are owned by the same user (or a
single user and the operating system). User processes, and system processes
that provide services to the user, are managed so that each frequently gets a
slice of computer time. Consider the windows created while a user is working
on a PC, for example, and the fact that they may be performing different tasks
at the same time. Even a web browser can be composed of multiple processes,
one for each website currently being visited, with time sharing applied to each
web browser process.
Mobile Computing
Mobile computing refers to computing on handheld smartphones and tablet
computers. These devices share the distinguishing physical features of being
portable and lightweight. Historically, compared with desktop and laptop
computers, mobile systems gave up screen size, memory capacity, and overall
functionality in return for handheld mobile access to services such as e-mail
and web browsing. Over the past few years, however, features on mobile
devices have become so rich that the distinction in functionality between, say,
a consumer laptop and a tablet computer may be difficult to discern. In fact,
we might argue that the features of a contemporary mobile device allow it to
provide functionality that is either unavailable or impractical on a desktop or
laptop computer.
Today, mobile systems are used not only for e-mail and web browsing but
also for playing music and video, reading digital books, taking photos, and
recording and editing high-definition video. Accordingly, tremendous growth
continues in the wide range of applications that run on such devices. Many
developers are now designing applications that take advantage of the unique
features of mobile devices, such as global positioning system (GPS) chips,
accelerometers, and gyroscopes. An embedded GPS chip allows a mobile device
to use satellites to determine its precise location on Earth. That functionality is
Introduction
especially useful in designing applications that provide navigation—for exam-
ple, telling users which way to walk or drive or perhaps directing them to
nearby services, such as restaurants. An accelerometer allows a mobile device
to detect its orientation with respect to the ground and to detect certain other
forces, such as tilting and shaking. In several computer games that employ
accelerometers, players interface with the system not by using a mouse or a
keyboard but rather by tilting, rotating, and shaking the mobile device! Perhaps
more a practical use of these features is found in augmented-reality appli-
cations, which overlay information on a display of the current environment.
It is difficult to imagine how equivalent applications could be developed on
traditional laptop or desktop computer systems.
To provide access to on-line services, mobile devices typically use either
IEEE standard 802.11 wireless or cellular data networks. The memory capacity
and processing speed of mobile devices, however, are more limited than those
of PCs. Whereas a smartphone or tablet may have 256 GB in storage, it is not
uncommon to find 8 TB in storage on a desktop computer. Similarly, because
power consumption is such a concern, mobile devices often use processors that
are smaller, are slower, and offer fewer processing cores than processors found
on traditional desktop and laptop computers.
Two operating systems currently dominate mobile computing: Apple iOS
and Google Android. iOS was designed to run on Apple iPhone and iPad
mobile devices. Android powers smartphones and tablet computers available
from many manufacturers. We examine these two mobile operating systems in
further detail in Chapter 2.
Client–Server Computing
Contemporary network architecture features arrangements in which server
systems satisfy requests generated by client systems. This form of specialized
distributed system, called a client–server system, has the general structure
depicted in Figure 1.22.
Server systems can be broadly categorized as compute servers and file
servers:
• The compute-server system provides an interface to which a client can
send a request to perform an action (for example, read data). In response,
the server executes the action and sends the results to the client. A server

running a database that responds to client requests for data is an example
of such a system.
• The file-serve system provides a file-system interface where clients can
create, update, read, and delete files. An example of such a system is a
web server that delivers files to clients running web browsers. The actual
contents of the files can vary greatly, ranging from traditional web pages
to rich multimedia content such as high-definition video.
Peer-to-Peer Computing
Another structure for a distributed system is the peer-to-peer (P2P) system
model. In this model, clients and servers are not distinguished from one
another. Instead, all nodes within the system are considered peers, and each
may act as either a client or a server, depending on whether it is requesting or
providing a service. Peer-to-peer systems offer an advantage over traditional
client–server systems. In a client–server system, the server is a bottleneck; but
in a peer-to-peer system, services can be provided by several nodes distributed
throughout the network.
To participate in a peer-to-peer system, a node must first join the network
of peers. Once a node has joined the network, it can begin providing services
to—and requesting services from—other nodes in the network. Determining
what services are available is accomplished in one of two general ways:
• When a node joins a network, it registers its service with a centralized
lookup service on the network. Any node desiring a specific service first
contacts this centralized lookup service to determine which node provides
the service. The remainder of the communication takes place between the
client and the service provider.
• An alternative scheme uses no centralized lookup service. Instead, a peer
acting as a client must discover what node provides a desired service by
broadcasting a request for the service to all other nodes in the network.
The node (or nodes) providing that service responds to the peer making
the request. To support this approach, a discovery protocol must be pro-
vided that allows peers to discover services provided by other peers in the
network. Figure 1.23 illustrates such a scenario.
Peer-to-peer networks gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s with
several file-sharing services, such as Napster and Gnutella, that enabled peers
to exchange files with one another. The Napster system used an approach simi-
lar to the first type described above: a centralized server maintained an index of
all files stored on peer nodes in the Napster network, and the actual exchange
of files took place between the peer nodes. The Gnutella system used a tech-
nique similar to the second type: a client broadcast file requests to other nodes
in the system, and nodes that could service the request responded directly to
the client. Peer-to-peer networks can be used to exchange copyrighted mate-
rials (music, for example) anonymously, and there are laws governing the
distribution of copyrighted material. Notably, Napster ran into legal trouble
for copyright infringement, and its services were shut down in 2001. For this
reason, the future of exchanging files remains uncertain.

Skype is another example of peer-to-peer computing. It allows clients to
make voice calls and video calls and to send text messages over the Internet
using a technology known as voice over IP (VoIP). Skype uses a hybrid peer-
to-peer approach. It includes a centralized login server, but it also incorporates
decentralized peers and allows two peers to communicate.
Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a type of computing that delivers computing, storage,
and even applications as a service across a network. In some ways, it’s a
logical extension of virtualization, because it uses virtualization as a base for
its functionality. For example, the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (ec2) facility
has thousands of servers, millions of virtual machines, and petabytes of storage
available for use by anyone on the Internet. Users pay per month based on
how much of those resources they use. There are actually many types of cloud
computing, including the following:
• Public cloud—a cloud available via the Internet to anyone willing to pay
for the services
• Private cloud—a cloud run by a company for that company’s own use
• Hybrid cloud—a cloud that includes both public and private cloud com-
ponents
• Software as a service (SaaS)—one or more applications (such as word
processors or spreadsheets) available via the Internet
• Platform as a service (PaaS)—a software stack ready for application use
via the Internet (for example, a database server)
• Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)—servers or storage available over the
Internet (for example, storage available for making backup copies of pro-
duction data)

Cloud computing.
These cloud-computing types are not discrete, as a cloud computing environ-
ment may provide a combination of several types. For example, an organiza-
tion may provide both SaaS and IaaS as publicly available services.
Certainly, there are traditional operating systems within many of the types
of cloud infrastructure. Beyond those are the VMMs that manage the virtual
machines in which the user processes run. At a higher level, the VMMs them-
selves are managed by cloud management tools, such as VMware vCloud
Director and the open-source Eucalyptus toolset. These tools manage the
resources within a given cloud and provide interfaces to the cloud components,
making a good argument for considering them a new type of operating system.
Figure 1.24 illustrates a public cloud providing IaaS. Notice that both the
cloud services and the cloud user interface are protected by a firewall.
Real-Time Embedded Systems
Embedded computers are the most prevalent form of computers in existence.
These devices are found everywhere, from car engines and manufacturing
robots to optical drives and microwave ovens. They tend to have very specific
tasks. The systems they run on are usually primitive, and so the operating
systems provide limited features. Usually, they have little or no user interface,
preferring to spend their time monitoring and managing hardware devices,
such as automobile engines and robotic arms.
These embedded systems vary considerably. Some are general-purpose
computers, running standard operating systems—such as Linux—with
special-purpose applications to implement the functionality. Others are
hardware devices with a special-purpose embedded operating system
providing just the functionality desired. Yet others are hardware devices
Introduction
with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that perform their tasks
without an operating system.
The use of embedded systems continues to expand. The power of these
devices, both as standalone units and as elements of networks and the web, is
sure to increase as well. Even now, entire houses can be computerized, so that a
central computer—either a general-purpose computer or an embedded system
—can control heating and lighting, alarm systems, and even coffee makers.
Web access can enable a home owner to tell the house to heat up before she
arrives home. Someday, the refrigerator will be able to notify the grocery store
when it notices the milk is gone.
Embedded systems almost always run real-time operating systems. Areal-
time system is used when rigid time requirements have been placed on the
operation of a processor or the flow of data; thus, it is often used as a control
device in a dedicated application. Sensors bring data to the computer. The com-
puter must analyze the data and possibly adjust controls to modify the sensor
inputs. Systems that control scientific experiments, medical imaging systems,
industrial control systems, and certain display systems are real-time systems.
Some automobile-engine fuel-injection systems, home-appliance controllers,
and weapon systems are also real-time systems.
A real-time system has well-defined, fixed time constraints. Processing
must be done within the defined constraints, or the system will fail. For
instance, it would not do for a robot arm to be instructed to halt after it had
smashed into the car it was building. A real-time system functions correctly
only if it returns the correct result within its time constraints. Contrast this sys-
tem with a traditional laptop system where it is desirable (but not mandatory)
to respond quickly.
In Chapter 5, we consider the scheduling facility needed to implement real-
time functionality in an operating system, and in Chapter 20 we describe the
real-time components of Linux.
Free and Open-Source Operating Systems
The study of operating systems has been made easier by the avail-
ability of a vast number of free software and open-source releases.
Both
free
operating
systems
and
open-source
operating
systems
are available in source-code
format rather
than
as
compiled binary
code. Note, though, that free software and open-source software are
two
different
ideas
championed
by
different
groups
of
people
(see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html/
for
a
discussion on the topic). Free software (sometimes referred to as free/libre
software) not only makes source code available but also is licensed to allow
no-cost use, redistribution, and modification. Open-source software does
not necessarily offer such licensing. Thus, although all free software is open
source, some open-source software is not “free.” GNU/Linux is the most
famous open-source operating system, with some distributions free and
others open source only (http://www.gnu.org/distros/). Microsoft Windows
is a well-known example of the opposite closed-source approach. Windows
is proprietary software—Microsoft owns it, restricts its use, and carefully
protects its source code. Apple’s macOS operating system comprises a hybrid
Free and Open-Source Operating Systems
approach. It contains an open-source kernel named Darwin but includes
proprietary, closed-source components as well.
Starting with the source code allows the programmer to produce binary
code that can be executed on a system. Doing the opposite—reverse engi-
neering the source code from the binaries—is quite a lot of work, and useful
items such as comments are never recovered. Learning operating systems by
examining the source code has other benefits as well. With the source code
in hand, a student can modify the operating system and then compile and
run the code to try out those changes, which is an excellent learning tool.
This text includes projects that involve modifying operating-system source
code, while also describing algorithms at a high level to be sure all important
operating-system topics are covered. Throughout the text, we provide pointers
to examples of open-source code for deeper study.
There are many benefits to open-source operating systems, including a
community of interested (and usually unpaid) programmers who contribute to
the code by helping to write it, debug it, analyze it, provide support, and sug-
gest changes. Arguably, open-source code is more secure than closed-source
code because many more eyes are viewing the code. Certainly, open-source
code has bugs, but open-source advocates argue that bugs tend to be found
and fixed faster owing to the number of people using and viewing the code.
Companies that earn revenue from selling their programs often hesitate to
open-source their code, but Red Hat and a myriad of other companies are doing
just that and showing that commercial companies benefit, rather than suffer,
when they open-source their code. Revenue can be generated through support
contracts and the sale of hardware on which the software runs, for example.
History
In the early days of modern computing (that is, the 1950s), software generally
came with source code. The original hackers (computer enthusiasts) at MIT’s
Tech Model Railroad Club left their programs in drawers for others to work on.
“Homebrew” user groups exchanged code during their meetings. Company-
specific user groups, such as Digital Equipment Corporation’s DECUS, accepted
contributions of source-code programs, collected them onto tapes, and dis-
tributed the tapes to interested members. In 1970, Digital’s operating systems
were distributed as source code with no restrictions or copyright notice.
Computer and software companies eventually sought to limit the use of
their software to authorized computers and paying customers. Releasing only
the binary files compiled from the source code, rather than the source code
itself, helped them to achieve this goal, as well as protecting their code and their
ideas from their competitors. Although the Homebrew user groups of the 1970s
exchanged code during their meetings, the operating systems for hobbyist
machines (such as CPM) were proprietary. By 1980, proprietary software was
the usual case.
Free Operating Systems
To counter the move to limit software use and redistribution, Richard Stallman
in 1984 started developing a free, UNIX-compatible operating system called
GNU(which is a recursive acronym for “GNU’s Not Unix!”). To Stallman, “free”
refers to freedom of use, not price. The free-software movement does not object
Introduction
to trading a copy for an amount of money but holds that users are entitled to
four certain freedoms: (1) to freely run the program, (2) to study and change
the source code, and to give or sell copies either (3) with or (4) without changes.
In 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which argues that all software
should be free. He also formed the Free Software Foundation (FSF) with the
goal of encouraging the use and development of free software.
The FSF uses the copyrights on its programs to implement “copyleft,” a
form of licensing invented by Stallman. Copylefting a work gives anyone that
possesses a copy of the work the four essential freedoms that make the work
free, with the condition that redistribution must preserve these freedoms. The
GNU General Public License (GPL) is a common license under which free
software is released. Fundamentally, the GPL requires that the source code be
distributed with any binaries and that all copies (including modified versions)
be released under the same GPL license. The Creative Commons “Attribution
Sharealike” license is also a copyleft license; “sharealike” is another way of
stating the idea of copyleft.
GNU/Linux
As an example of a free and open-source operating system, consider
GNU/Linux. By 1991, the GNU operating system was nearly complete. The
GNU Project had developed compilers, editors, utilities, libraries, and games
— whatever parts it could not find elsewhere. However, the GNU kernel never
became ready for prime time. In 1991, a student in Finland, Linus Torvalds,
released a rudimentary UNIX-like kernel using the GNU compilers and tools
and invited contributions worldwide. The advent of the Internet meant that
anyone interested could download the source code, modify it, and submit
changes to Torvalds. Releasing updates once a week allowed this so-called
“Linux” operating system to grow rapidly, enhanced by several thousand
programmers. In 1991, Linux was not free software, as its license permitted
only noncommercial redistribution. In 1992, however, Torvalds rereleased
Linux under the GPL, making it free software (and also, to use a term coined
later, “open source”).
The resulting GNU/Linux operating system (with the kernel properly
called Linux but the full operating system including GNU tools called
GNU/Linux) has spawned hundreds of unique distributions, or custom
builds, of the system. Major distributions include Red Hat, SUSE, Fedora,
Debian, Slackware, and Ubuntu. Distributions vary in function, utility,
installed applications, hardware support, user interface, and purpose. For
example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is geared to large commercial use.
PCLinuxOS is a live CD—an operating system that can be booted and run
from a CD-ROM without being installed on a system’s boot disk. A variant of
PCLinuxOS—called PCLinuxOS Supergamer DVD—is a live DVD that includes
graphics drivers and games. A gamer can run it on any compatible system
simply by booting from the DVD. When the gamer is finished, a reboot of the
system resets it to its installed operating system.
You can run Linux on a Windows (or other) system using the following
simple, free approach:
Free and Open-Source Operating Systems
1. Download the free Virtualbox VMM tool from
https://www.virtualbox.org/
and install it on your system.
2. Choose to install an operating system from scratch, based on an
installation image like a CD, or choose pre-built operating-system images
that can be installed and run more quickly from a site like
http://virtualboxes.org/images/
These images are preinstalled with operating systems and applications
and include many flavors of GNU/Linux.
3. Boot the virtual machine within Virtualbox.
An alternative to using Virtualbox is to use the free program Qemu
(http://wiki.qemu.org/Download/), which includes the qemu-img command
for converting Virtualbox images to Qemu images to easily import them.
With this text, we provide a virtual machine image of GNU/Linux running
the Ubuntu release. This image contains the GNU/Linux source code as well as
tools for software development. We cover examples involving the GNU/Linux
image throughout this text, as well as in a detailed case study in Chapter 20.
BSD UNIX
BSD UNIX has a longer and more complicated history than Linux. It started in
1978 as a derivative of AT&T’s UNIX. Releases from the University of California
at Berkeley (UCB) came in source and binary form, but they were not open
source because a license from AT&T was required. BSD UNIX’s development was
slowed by a lawsuit by AT&T, but eventually a fully functional, open-source
version, 4.4BSD-lite, was released in 1994.
Just as with Linux, there are many distributions of BSD UNIX, including
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonflyBSD. To explore the source code
of FreeBSD, simply download the virtual machine image of the version of
interest and boot it within Virtualbox, as described above for Linux. The
source code comes with the distribution and is stored in /usr/src/. The
kernel source code is in /usr/src/sys. For example, to examine the vir-
tual memory implementation code in the FreeBSD kernel, see the files in
/usr/src/sys/vm. Alternatively, you can simply view the source code online
at https://svnweb.freebsd.org.
As with many open-source projects, this source code is contained in
and controlled by a version control system—in this case, “subversion”
(https://subversion.apache.org/source-code). Version control systems allow
a user to “pull” an entire source code tree to his computer and “push” any
changes back into the repository for others to then pull. These systems also
provide other features, including an entire history of each file and a conflict
resolution feature in case the same file is changed concurrently. Another
Introduction
version control system is git, which is used for GNU/Linux, as well as other
programs (http://www.git-scm.com).
Darwin, the core kernel component of macOS, is based on
BSD
UNIX and is open-sourced as well. That source code is available from
http://www.opensource.apple.com/. Every macOS release has its open-source
components posted at that site. The name of the package that contains the
kernel begins with “xnu.” Apple also provides extensive developer tools,
documentation, and support at http://developer.apple.com.
THE STUDY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS
There has never been a more interesting time to study operating systems,
and it has never been easier. The open-source movement has overtaken oper-
ating systems, causing many of them to be made available in both source and
binary (executable) format. The list of operating systems available in both
formats includes Linux, BSD UNIX, Solaris, and part of macOS. The availabil-
ity of source code allows us to study operating systems from the inside out.
Questions that we could once answer only by looking at documentation or
the behavior of an operating system we can now answer by examining the
code itself.
Operating systems that are no longer commercially viable have been
open-sourced as well, enabling us to study how systems operated in a
time of fewer CPU, memory, and storage resources. An extensive but
incomplete list of open-source operating-system projects is available from
http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Operating Systems/Open Source/.
In addition, the rise of virtualization as a mainstream (and frequently free)
computer function makes it possible to run many operating systems on top
of one core system. For example, VMware (http://www.vmware.com) pro-
vides a free “player” for Windows on which hundreds of free “virtual appli-
ances” can run. Virtualbox (http://www.virtualbox.com) provides a free,
open-source virtual machine manager on many operating systems. Using
such tools, students can try out hundreds of operating systems without ded-
icated hardware.
In some cases, simulators of specific hardware are also available, allow-
ing the operating system to run on “native” hardware, all within the con-
fines of a modern computer and modern operating system. For example,
a DECSYSTEM-20 simulator running on macOS can boot TOPS-20, load the
source tapes, and modify and compile a new TOPS-20 kernel. An interested
student can search the Internet to find the original papers that describe the
operating system, as well as the original manuals.
The advent of open-source operating systems has also made it easier to
make the move from student to operating-system developer. With some
knowledge, some effort, and an Internet connection, a student can even create
a new operating-system distribution. Not so many years ago, it was difficult
or impossible to get access to source code. Now, such access is limited only
by how much interest, time, and disk space a student has.

Solaris
Solaris is the commercial UNIX-based operating system of Sun Microsystems.
Originally, Sun’s SunOS operating system was based on BSD UNIX. Sun moved
to AT&T’s System V UNIX as its base in 1991. In 2005, Sun open-sourced most
of the Solaris code as the OpenSolaris project. The purchase of Sun by Oracle
in 2009, however, left the state of this project unclear.
Several groups interested in using OpenSolaris have expanded its features,
and their working set is Project Illumos, which has expanded from the Open-
Solaris base to include more features and to be the basis for several products.
Illumos is available at http://wiki.illumos.org.
Open-Source Systems as Learning Tools
The free-software movement is driving legions of programmers to create
thousands of open-source projects, including operating systems. Sites like
http://freshmeat.net/ and http://distrowatch.com/ provide portals to many of
these projects. As we stated earlier, open-source projects enable students to
use source code as a learning tool. They can modify programs and test them,
help find and fix bugs, and otherwise explore mature, full-featured operating
systems, compilers, tools, user interfaces, and other types of programs. The
availability of source code for historic projects, such as Multics, can help stu-
dents to understand those projects and to build knowledge that will help in the
implementation of new projects.
Another advantage of working with open-source operating systems is their
diversity. GNU/Linux and BSD UNIX are both open-source operating systems,
for instance, but each has its own goals, utility, licensing, and purpose. Some-
times, licenses are not mutually exclusive and cross-pollination occurs, allow-
ing rapid improvements in operating-system projects. For example, several
major components of OpenSolaris have been ported to BSD UNIX. The advan-
tages of free software and open sourcing are likely to increase the number
and quality of open-source projects, leading to an increase in the number of
individuals and companies that use these projects.


## 1.12 Summary
> id: ch01-1-12 | src: book 1.12 | kind: concept

• An operating system is software that manages the computer hardware, as
well as providing an environment for application programs to run.
• Interrupts are a key way in which hardware interacts with the operating
system. A hardware device triggers an interrupt by sending a signal to the
CPU to alert the CPU that some event requires attention. The interrupt is
managed by the interrupt handler.
• For a computer to do its job of executing programs, the programs must be
in main memory, which is the only large storage area that the processor
can access directly.
• The main memory is usually a volatile storage device that loses its contents
when power is turned off or lost.
Introduction
• Nonvolatile storage is an extension of main memory and is capable of
holding large quantities of data permanently.
• The most common nonvolatile storage device is a hard disk, which can
provide storage of both programs and data.
• The wide variety of storage systems in a computer system can be organized
in a hierarchy according to speed and cost. The higher levels are expensive,
but they are fast. As we move down the hierarchy, the cost per bit generally
decreases, whereas the access time generally increases.
• Modern computer architectures are multiprocessor systems in which each
CPU contains several computing cores.
• To best utilize the CPU, modern operating systems employ multiprogram-
ming, which allows several jobs to be in memory at the same time, thus
ensuring that the CPU always has a job to execute.
• Multitasking is an extension of multiprogramming wherein CPU schedul-
ing algorithms rapidly switch between processes, providing users with a
fast response time.
• To prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of
the system, the system hardware has two modes: user mode and kernel
mode.
• Various instructions are privileged and can be executed only in kernel
mode. Examples include the instruction to switch to kernel mode, I/O
control, timer management, and interrupt management.
• A process is the fundamental unit of work in an operating system. Pro-
cess management includes creating and deleting processes and providing
mechanisms for processes to communicate and synchronize with each
other.
• An operating system manages memory by keeping track of what parts of
memory are being used and by whom. It is also responsible for dynami-
cally allocating and freeing memory space.
• Storage space is managed by the operating system; this includes providing
file systems for representing files and directories and managing space on
mass-storage devices.
• Operating systems provide mechanisms for protecting and securing the
operating system and users. Protection measures control the access of
processes or users to the resources made available by the computer system.
• Virtualization involves abstracting a computer’s hardware into several
different execution environments.
• Data structures that are used in an operating system include lists, stacks,
queues, trees, and maps.
• Computing takes place in a variety of environments, including traditional
computing, mobile computing, client–server systems, peer-to-peer sys-
tems, cloud computing, and real-time embedded systems.

## 1.1 What are the three main purposes of an operating system?
> id: ch01-1-1 | src: book 1.1 | kind: concept




## 1.2 We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use
> id: ch01-1-2 | src: book 1.2 | kind: concept

of the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating
system to forsake this principle and to “waste” resources? Why is such
a system not really wasteful?


## 1.3 What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing
> id: ch01-1-3 | src: book 1.3 | kind: concept

an operating system for a real-time environment?


## 1.4 Keeping in mind the various definitions of operating system, consider
> id: ch01-1-4 | src: book 1.4 | kind: concept

whether the operating system should include applications such as web
browsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it
should not, and support your answers.


## 1.5 How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode function
> id: ch01-1-5 | src: book 1.5 | kind: concept

as a rudimentary form of protection (security)?


## 1.6 Which of the following instructions should be privileged?
> id: ch01-1-6 | src: book 1.6 | kind: concept

a.
Set value of timer.
b.
Read the clock.
c.
Clear memory.
d.
Issue a trap instruction.
e.
Turn off interrupts.
f.
Modify entries in device-status table.
g.
Switch from user to kernel mode.
h.
Access I/O device.


## 1.7 Some early computers protected the operating system by placing it in
> id: ch01-1-7 | src: book 1.7 | kind: concept

a memory partition that could not be modified by either the user job or
the operating system itself. Describe two difficulties that you think could
arise with such a scheme.


## 1.8 Some CPUs provide for more than two modes of operation. What are two
> id: ch01-1-8 | src: book 1.8 | kind: concept

possible uses of these multiple modes?


## 1.9 Timers could be used to compute the current time. Provide a short
> id: ch01-1-9 | src: book 1.9 | kind: concept

description of how this could be accomplished.
Give two reasons why caches are useful. What problems do they solve?
What problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as the
Introduction
device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk),
why not make it that large and eliminate the device?
Distinguish between the client–server and peer-to-peer models of dis-
tributed systems.
Further Reading
Many general textbooks cover operating systems, including [Stallings (2017)]
and [Tanenbaum (2014)]. [Hennessy and Patterson (2012)] provide coverage of
I/O systems and buses and of system architecture in general. [Kurose and Ross
(2017)] provides a general overview of computer networks.
[Russinovich et al. (2017)] give an overview of Microsoft Windows and cov-
ers considerable technical detail about the system internals and components.
[McDougall and Mauro (2007)] cover the internals of the Solaris operating
system. The macOS and iOS internals are discussed in [Levin (2013)]. [Levin
(2015)] covers the internals of Android. [Love (2010)] provides an overview of
the Linux operating system and great detail about data structures used in the
Linux kernel. The Free Software Foundation has published its philosophy at
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html.

How do clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems? What is
required for two machines belonging to a cluster to cooperate to provide
a highly available service?
Consider a computing cluster consisting of two nodes running a
database. Describe two ways in which the cluster software can manage
access to the data on the disk. Discuss the benefits and disadvantages
of each.
What is the purpose of interrupts? How does an interrupt differ from a
trap? Can traps be generated intentionally by a user program? If so, for
what purpose?
Explain how the Linux kernel variables HZ and jiffies can be used to
determine the number of seconds the system has been running since it
was booted.
Direct memory access is used for high-speed I/O devices in order to
avoid increasing the CPU’s execution load.
a.
How does the CPU interface with the device to coordinate the
transfer?
b.
How does the CPU know when the memory operations are com-
plete?
c.
The CPU is allowed to execute other programs while the DMA
controller is transferring data. Does this process interfere with
the execution of the user programs? If so, describe what forms of
interference are caused.
EX-1
Some computer systems do not provide a privileged mode of operation
in hardware. Is it possible to construct a secure operating system for
these computer systems? Give arguments both that it is and that it is
not possible.
Many SMP systems have different levels of caches; one level is local to
each processing core, and another level is shared among all processing
cores. Why are caching systems designed this way?
Rank the following storage systems from slowest to fastest:
a.
Hard-disk drives
b.
Registers
c.
Optical disk
d.
Main memory
e.
Nonvolatile memory
f.
Magnetic tapes
g.
Cache
