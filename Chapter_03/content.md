Processes
Early computers allowed only one program to be executed at a time. This pro-
gram had complete control of the system and had access to all the system’s
resources. In contrast, contemporary computer systems allow multiple pro-
grams to be loaded into memory and executed concurrently. This evolution
required firmer control and more compartmentalization of the various pro-
grams; and these needs resulted in the notion of a process, which is a program
in execution. A process is the unit of work in a modern computing system.
The more complex the operating system is, the more it is expected to do on
behalf of its users. Although its main concern is the execution of user programs,
it also needs to take care of various system tasks that are best done in user space,
rather than within the kernel. A system therefore consists of a collection of
processes, some executing user code, others executing operating system code.
Potentially, all these processes can execute concurrently, with the CPU (or CPUs)
multiplexed among them. In this chapter, you will read about what processes
are, how they are represented in an operating system, and how they work.
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

represented and scheduled in an operating system.

tem, including developing programs using the appropriate system calls
that perform these operations.

## 3.1 Process Concept
> id: ch03-3-1 | src: book 3.1; slides 4-12 | kind: concept

A question that arises in discussing operating systems involves what to call
all the CPU activities. Early computers were batch systems that executed jobs,
followed by the emergence of time-shared systems that ran user programs, or
tasks. Even on a single-user system, a user may be able to run several programs
at one time: a word processor, a web browser, and an e-mail package. And even
if a computer can execute only one program at a time, such as on an embedded
device that does not support multitasking, the operating system may need to
support its own internal programmed activities, such as memory management.
In many respects, all these activities are similar, so we call all of them processes.
Although we personally prefer the more contemporary term process, the
term job has historical significance, as much of operating system theory and
terminology was developed during a time when the major activity of operating
systems was job processing. Therefore, in some appropriate instances we use
job when describing the role of the operating system. As an example, it would
be misleading to avoid the use of commonly accepted terms that include the
word job (such as job scheduling) simply because process has superseded job.
The Process
Informally, as mentioned earlier, a process is a program in execution. The status
of the current activity of a process is represented by the value of the program
counter and the contents of the processor’s registers. The memory layout of a
process is typically divided into multiple sections, and is shown in Figure 3.1.
These sections include:
• Text section—the executable code
• Data section—global variables
text
max
data
heap
stack
Figure 3.1
Layout of a process in memory.


- An operating system executes a variety of programs that run as a process.
- Process – a program in execution; process execution must progress in sequential fashion. No parallel execution of instructions of a  single process
- Multiple parts
  - The program code, also called text section
  - Current activity including program counter, processor registers
  - Stack containing temporary data
    - Function parameters, return addresses, local variables
  - Data section containing global variables
  - Heap containing memory dynamically allocated during run time


**Process Concept (Cont.)**

- Program is passive entity stored on disk (executable file); process is active
  - Program becomes process when an executable file is loaded into memory
- Execution of program started via GUI mouse clicks, command line entry of its name, etc.
- One program can be several processes
  - Consider multiple users executing the same program

## 3.1 Process Concept

• Heap section—memory that is dynamically allocated during program run
time
• Stack section—temporary data storage when invoking functions (such as
function parameters, return addresses, and local variables)
Notice that the sizes of the text and data sections are fixed, as their sizes do
not change during program run time. However, the stack and heap sections can
shrink and grow dynamically during program execution. Each time a function
is called, an activation record containing function parameters, local variables,
and the return address is pushed onto the stack; when control is returned from
the function, the activation record is popped from the stack. Similarly, the heap
will grow as memory is dynamically allocated, and will shrink when memory
is returned to the system. Although the stack and heap sections grow toward
one another, the operating system must ensure they do not overlap one another.
We emphasize that a program by itself is not a process. A program is a
passive entity, such as a file containing a list of instructions stored on disk
(often called an executable fil ). In contrast, a process is an active entity,
with a program counter specifying the next instruction to execute and a set
of associated resources. A program becomes a process when an executable file
is loaded into memory. Two common techniques for loading executable files
are double-clicking an icon representing the executable file and entering the
name of the executable file on the command line (as in prog.exe or a.out).
Although two processes may be associated with the same program, they
are nevertheless considered two separate execution sequences. For instance,
several users may be running different copies of the mail program, or the same
user may invoke many copies of the web browser program. Each of these is a
separate process; and although the text sections are equivalent, the data, heap,
and stack sections vary. It is also common to have a process that spawns many
processes as it runs. We discuss such matters in Section 3.4.
Note that a process can itself be an execution environment for other code.
The Java programming environment provides a good example. In most cir-
cumstances, an executable Java program is executed within the Java virtual
machine (JVM). The JVM executes as a process that interprets the loaded Java
code and takes actions (via native machine instructions) on behalf of that code.
For example, to run the compiled Java program Program.class, we would
enter
java Program
The command java runs the JVM as an ordinary process, which in turns
executes the Java program Program in the virtual machine. The concept is the
same as simulation, except that the code, instead of being written for a different
instruction set, is written in the Java language.
Process State
As a process executes, it changes state. The state of a process is defined in part
by the current activity of that process. A process may be in one of the following
states:
Processes
MEMORY LAYOUT OF A C PROGRAM
The figure shown below illustrates the layout of a C program in memory,
highlighting how the different sections of a process relate to an actual C
program. This figure is similar to the general concept of a process in memory
as shown in Figure 3.1, with a few differences:
• The global data section is divided into different sections for (a) initialized
data and (b) uninitialized data.
• A separate section is provided for the argc and argv parameters passed
to the main() function.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int x;
int y = 15;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
int *values;
int i;
values = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*5);
for(i = 0; i < 5; i++)
values[i] = i;
return 0;
}
argc, agrv
uninitialized
data
high
memory
low
memory
initialized
data
stack
heap
text
The GNU size command can be used to determine the size (in bytes) of
some of these sections. Assuming the name of the executable file of the above
C program is memory, the following is the output generated by entering the
command size memory:
text
data
bss
dec
hex
filename
5aa
memory
The data field refers to uninitialized data, and bss refers to initialized data.
(bss is a historical term referring to block started by symbol.) The dec and
hex values are the sum of the three sections represented in decimal and
hexadecimal, respectively.
• New. The process is being created.
• Running. Instructions are being executed.
• Waiting. The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O
completion or reception of a signal).
• Ready. The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.

• Terminated. The process has finished execution.
These names are arbitrary, and they vary across operating systems. The states
that they represent are found on all systems, however. Certain operating sys-
tems also more finely delineate process states. It is important to realize that
only one process can be running on any processor core at any instant. Many
processes may be ready and waiting, however. The state diagram corresponding
to these states is presented in Figure 3.2.
Process Control Block
Each process is represented in the operating system by a process control
block (PCB)—also called a task control block. A PCB is shown in Figure 3.3.
It contains many pieces of information associated with a specific process,
including these:
• Process state. The state may be new, ready, running, waiting, halted, and
so on.
• Program counter. The counter indicates the address of the next instruction
to be executed for this process.
process state
process number
program counter
memory limits
list of open files
registers

Process control block (PCB).
Processes
• CPU registers. The registers vary in number and type, depending on the
computer architecture. They include accumulators, index registers, stack
pointers, and general-purpose registers, plus any condition-code informa-
tion. Along with the program counter, this state information must be saved
when an interrupt occurs, to allow the process to be continued correctly
afterward when it is rescheduled to run.
• CPU-scheduling information. This information includes a process prior-
ity, pointers to scheduling queues, and any other scheduling parameters.
(Chapter 5 describes process scheduling.)
• Memory-management information. This information may include such
items as the value of the base and limit registers and the page tables, or the
segment tables, depending on the memory system used by the operating
system (Chapter 9).
• Accounting information. This information includes the amount of CPU
and real time used, time limits, account numbers, job or process numbers,
and so on.
• I/O status information. This information includes the list of I/O devices
allocated to the process, a list of open files, and so on.
In brief, the PCB simply serves as the repository for all the data needed to start,
or restart, a process, along with some accounting data.
Threads
The process model discussed so far has implied that a process is a program that
performs a single thread of execution. For example, when a process is running
a word-processor program, a single thread of instructions is being executed.
This single thread of control allows the process to perform only one task at a
time. Thus, the user cannot simultaneously type in characters and run the spell
checker. Most modern operating systems have extended the process concept
to allow a process to have multiple threads of execution and thus to perform
more than one task at a time. This feature is especially beneficial on multicore
systems, where multiple threads can run in parallel. A multithreaded word
processor could, for example, assign one thread to manage user input while
another thread runs the spell checker. On systems that support threads, the PCB
is expanded to include information for each thread. Other changes throughout
the system are also needed to support threads. Chapter 4 explores threads in
detail.


## 3.2 Process Scheduling
> id: ch03-3-2 | src: book 3.2; slides 13-18 | kind: concept

The objective of multiprogramming is to have some process running at all times
so as to maximize CPU utilization. The objective of time sharing is to switch
a CPU core among processes so frequently that users can interact with each
program while it is running. To meet these objectives, the process scheduler
selects an available process (possibly from a set of several available processes)
for program execution on a core. Each CPU core can run one process at a time.


- Process scheduler selects among available processes for next execution on CPU core
- Goal -- Maximize CPU use, quickly switch processes onto CPU core
- Maintains scheduling queues of processes
  - Ready queue – set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute
  - Wait queues – set of processes waiting for an event (i.e., I/O)
  - Processes migrate among the various queues

**Context Switch**

- When CPU switches to another process, the system must save the state of the old process and load the saved state for the new process via a context switch
- Context of a process represented in the PCB
- Context-switch time is pure overhead; the system does no useful work while switching
  - The more complex the OS and the PCB  the longer the context switch
- Time dependent on hardware support
  - Some hardware provides multiple sets of registers per CPU  multiple contexts loaded at once


**Multitasking in Mobile Systems**

- Some mobile systems (e.g., early version of iOS)  allow only one process to run, others suspended
- Due to screen real estate, user interface limits iOS provides for a
  - Single foreground process- controlled via user interface
  - Multiple background processes– in memory, running, but not on the display, and with limits
  - Limits include single, short task, receiving notification of events, specific long-running tasks like audio playback
- Android runs foreground and background, with fewer limits
  - Background process uses a service to perform tasks
  - Service can keep running even if background process is suspended
  - Service has no user interface, small memory use

PROCESS REPRESENTATION IN LINUX
The
process
control
block
in
the
Linux
operating
system
is
rep-
resented by the C structure task struct, which is found in the
<include/linux/sched.h>
include
file
in
the
kernel
source-code
directory.
This
structure
contains
all
the
necessary
information
for
representing a process, including the state of the process, scheduling
and memory-management information, list of open files, and pointers to the
process’s parent and a list of its children and siblings. (A process’s parent
is the process that created it; its children are any processes that it creates.
Its siblings are children with the same parent process.) Some of these fields
include:
long state;
/* state of the process */
struct sched entity se;
/* scheduling information */
struct task struct *parent;
/* this process’s parent */
struct list head children;
/* this process’s children */
struct files struct *files;
/* list of open files */
struct mm struct *mm;
/* address space */
For example, the state of a process is represented by the field long state
in this structure. Within the Linux kernel, all active processes are represented
using a doubly linked list of task struct. The kernel maintains a pointer–
current–to the process currently executing on the system, as shown below:
struct task_struct
process information
•
•
•
struct task_struct
process information
•
•
•
current
(currently executing proccess)
struct task_struct
process information
•
•
•
•  •  •
As an illustration of how the kernel might manipulate one of the fields in
the task struct for a specified process, let’s assume the system would like
to change the state of the process currently running to the value new state.
If current is a pointer to the process currently executing, its state is changed
with the following:
current->state = new state;
For a system with a single CPU core, there will never be more than one process
running at a time, whereas a multicore system can run multiple processes at
one time. If there are more processes than cores, excess processes will have

to wait until a core is free and can be rescheduled. The number of processes
currently in memory is known as the degree of multiprogramming.
Balancing the objectives of multiprogramming and time sharing also
requires taking the general behavior of a process into account. In general, most
processes can be described as either I/O bound or CPU bound. An I/O-bound
process is one that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends doing
computations. A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/O requests
infrequently, using more of its time doing computations.
Scheduling Queues
As processes enter the system, they are put into a ready queue, where they are
ready and waiting to execute on a CPU’s core This queue is generally stored as
a linked list; a ready-queue header contains pointers to the first PCB in the list,
and each PCB includes a pointer field that points to the next PCB in the ready
queue.
The system also includes other queues. When a process is allocated a CPU
core, it executes for a while and eventually terminates, is interrupted, or waits
for the occurrence of a particular event, such as the completion of an I/O
request. Suppose the process makes an I/O request to a device such as a disk.
Since devices run significantly slower than processors, the process will have
to wait for the I/O to become available. Processes that are waiting for a certain
event to occur — such as completion of I/O — are placed in a wait queue
(Figure 3.4).
A common representation of process scheduling is a queueing diagram,
such as that in Figure 3.5. Two types of queues are present: the ready queue and
a set of wait queues. The circles represent the resources that serve the queues,
and the arrows indicate the flow of processes in the system.
A new process is initially put in the ready queue. It waits there until it is
selected for execution, or dispatched. Once the process is allocated a CPU core
and is executing, one of several events could occur:

• The process could issue an I/O request and then be placed in an I/O wait
queue.
• The process could create a new child process and then be placed in a wait
queue while it awaits the child’s termination.
• The process could be removed forcibly from the core, as a result of an
interrupt or having its time slice expire, and be put back in the ready queue.
In the first two cases, the process eventually switches from the waiting state
to the ready state and is then put back in the ready queue. A process continues
this cycle until it terminates, at which time it is removed from all queues and
has its PCB and resources deallocated.
CPU Scheduling
A process migrates among the ready queue and various wait queues through-
out its lifetime. The role of the CPU scheduler is to select from among the
processes that are in the ready queue and allocate a CPU core to one of them. The
CPU scheduler must select a new process for the CPU frequently. An I/O-bound
process may execute for only a few milliseconds before waiting for an I/O
request. Although a CPU-bound process will require a CPU core for longer dura-
tions, the scheduler is unlikely to grant the core to a process for an extended
period. Instead, it is likely designed to forcibly remove the CPU from a process
and schedule another process to run. Therefore, the CPU scheduler executes at
least once every 100 milliseconds, although typically much more frequently.
Some operating systems have an intermediate form of scheduling, known
as swapping, whose key idea is that sometimes it can be advantageous to
remove a process from memory (and from active contention for the CPU)
and thus reduce the degree of multiprogramming. Later, the process can be
reintroduced into memory, and its execution can be continued where it left off.
This scheme is known as swapping because a process can be “swapped out”
Processes
from memory to disk, where its current status is saved, and later “swapped in”
from disk back to memory, where its status is restored. Swapping is typically
only necessary when memory has been overcommitted and must be freed up.
Swapping is discussed in Chapter 9.
Context Switch
As mentioned in Section 1.2.1, interrupts cause the operating system to change
a CPU core from its current task and to run a kernel routine. Such operations
happen frequently on general-purpose systems. When an interrupt occurs, the
system needs to save the current context of the process running on the CPU
core so that it can restore that context when its processing is done, essentially
suspending the process and then resuming it. The context is represented in
the PCB of the process. It includes the value of the CPU registers, the process
state (see Figure 3.2), and memory-management information. Generically, we
perform a state save of the current state of the CPU core, be it in kernel or user
mode, and then a state restore to resume operations.
Switching the CPU core to another process requires performing a state
save of the current process and a state restore of a different process. This
task is known as a context switch and is illustrated in Figure 3.6. When a
context switch occurs, the kernel saves the context of the old process in its
PCB and loads the saved context of the new process scheduled to run. Context-
switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while
switching. Switching speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the

MULTITASKING IN MOBILE SYSTEMS
Because of the constraints imposed on mobile devices, early versions of iOS
did not provide user-application multitasking; only one application ran in
the foreground while all other user applications were suspended. Operating-
system tasks were multitasked because they were written by Apple and well
behaved. However, beginning with iOS 4, Apple provided a limited form of
multitasking for user applications, thus allowing a single foreground appli-
cation to run concurrently with multiple background applications. (On a
mobile device, the foreground application is the application currently open
and appearing on the display. The background application remains in mem-
ory, but does not occupy the display screen.) The iOS 4 programming API
provided support for multitasking, thus allowing a process to run in the back-
ground without being suspended. However, it was limited and only available
for a few application types. As hardware for mobile devices began to offer
larger memory capacities, multiple processing cores, and greater battery life,
subsequent versions of iOS began to support richer functionality for multi-
tasking with fewer restrictions. For example, the larger screen on iPad tablets
allowed running two foreground apps at the same time, a technique known
as split-screen.
Since its origins, Android has supported multitasking and does not place
constraints on the types of applications that can run in the background. If
an application requires processing while in the background, the application
must use a service, a separate application component that runs on behalf
of the background process. Consider a streaming audio application: if the
application moves to the background, the service continues to send audio
data to the audio device driver on behalf of the background application. In
fact, the service will continue to run even if the background application is
suspended. Services do not have a user interface and have a small memory
footprint, thus providing an efficient technique for multitasking in a mobile
environment.
memory speed, the number of registers that must be copied, and the existence
of special instructions (such as a single instruction to load or store all registers).
A typical speed is a several microseconds.
Context-switch times are highly dependent on hardware support. For
instance, some processors provide multiple sets of registers. A context switch
here simply requires changing the pointer to the current register set. Of course,
if there are more active processes than there are register sets, the system resorts
to copying register data to and from memory, as before. Also, the more complex
the operating system, the greater the amount of work that must be done during
a context switch. As we will see in Chapter 9, advanced memory-management
techniques may require that extra data be switched with each context. For
instance, the address space of the current process must be preserved as the
space of the next task is prepared for use. How the address space is preserved,
and what amount of work is needed to preserve it, depend on the memory-
management method of the operating system.
Processes


## 3.3 Operations on Processes
> id: ch03-3-3 | src: book 3.3; slides 19-28 | kind: concept

The processes in most systems can execute concurrently, and they may be cre-
ated and deleted dynamically. Thus, these systems must provide a mechanism
for process creation and termination. In this section, we explore the mecha-
nisms involved in creating processes and illustrate process creation on UNIX
and Windows systems.
Process Creation
During the course of execution, a process may create several new processes. As
mentioned earlier, the creating process is called a parent process, and the new
processes are called the children of that process. Each of these new processes
may in turn create other processes, forming a tree of processes.
Most operating systems (including UNIX, Linux, and Windows) identify
processes according to a unique process identifie (or pid), which is typically
an integer number. The pid provides a unique value for each process in the
system, and it can be used as an index to access various attributes of a process
within the kernel.
Figure 3.7 illustrates a typical process tree for the Linux operating system,
showing the name of each process and its pid. (We use the term process rather
loosely in this situation, as Linux prefers the term task instead.) The systemd
process (which always has a pid of 1) serves as the root parent process for all
user processes, and is the first user process created when the system boots.
Once the system has booted, the systemd process creates processes which
provide additional services such as a web or print server, an ssh server, and
the like. In Figure 3.7, we see two children of systemd—logind and sshd.
The logind process is responsible for managing clients that directly log onto
the system. In this example, a client has logged on and is using the bash shell,
which has been assigned pid 8416. Using the bash command-line interface,
this user has created the process ps as well as the vim editor. The sshd process
is responsible for managing clients that connect to the system by using ssh
(which is short for secure shell).
python
pid = 2808
logind
pid = 8415
systemd
pid = 1
bash
pid = 8416
ps
pid = 9298
vim
pid = 9204
sshd
pid = 3028

pid = 3610
tcsh
pid = 4005

- System must provide mechanisms for:
  - Process creation
  - Process termination


**Process Creation**

- Parent process create children processes, which, in turn create other processes, forming a tree of processes
- Generally, process identified and managed via a process identifier (pid)
- Resource sharing options
  - Parent and children share all resources
  - Children share subset of parent’s resources
  - Parent and child share no resources
- Execution options
  - Parent and children execute concurrently
  - Parent waits until children terminate


**Process Creation (Cont.)**

- Address space
  - Child duplicate of parent
  - Child has a program loaded into it
- UNIX examples
  - fork() system call creates new process
  - exec() system call used after a fork() to replace the process’ memory space with a new program
  - Parent process calls wait()waiting for the child to terminate

**Process Termination**

- Process executes last statement and then asks the operating system to delete it using the exit() system call.
  - Returns  status data from child to parent (via wait())
  - Process’ resources are deallocated by operating system
- Parent may terminate the execution of children processes  using the abort() system call.  Some reasons for doing so:
  - Child has exceeded allocated resources
  - Task assigned to child is no longer required
  - The parent is exiting, and the operating systems does not allow  a child to continue if its parent terminates


**Process Termination**

- Some operating systems do not allow child to exists if its parent has terminated.  If a process terminates, then all its children must also be terminated.
  - cascading termination.  All children, grandchildren, etc.,  are  terminated.
  - The termination is initiated by the operating system.
- The parent process may wait for termination of a child process by using the wait()system call. The call returns status information and the pid of the terminated process
- pid = wait(&status);
- If no parent waiting (did not invoke wait()) process is a zombie
- If parent terminated without invoking wait(), process is an orphan


**Android Process Importance Hierarchy**

- Mobile operating systems often have to terminate processes to reclaim system resources such as memory. From most to least important:
  - Foreground process
  - Visible process
  - Service process
  - Background process
  - Empty process
- Android will begin terminating processes that are least important.


**Multiprocess Architecture – Chrome Browser**

- Many web browsers ran as single process (some still do)
  - If one web site causes trouble, entire browser can hang or crash
- Google Chrome Browser is multiprocess with 3 different types of processes:
  - Browser process manages user interface, disk and network I/O
  - Renderer process renders web pages, deals with HTML, Javascript. A new renderer created for each website opened
    - Runs in sandbox restricting disk and network I/O, minimizing effect of security exploits
  - Plug-in process for each type of plug-in

## 3.3 Operations on Processes
> id: ch03-3-3 | src: book 3.3 | kind: concept

THE init AND systemd PROCESSES
Traditional UNIX systems identify the process init as the root of all child
processes. init (also known as System V init) is assigned a pid of 1, and is
the first process created when the system is booted. On a process tree similar
to what is shown in Figure 3.7, init is at the root.
Linux systems initially adopted the System V init approach, but recent
distributions have replaced it with systemd. As described in Section 3.3.1,
systemd serves as the system’s initial process, much the same as System V
init; however it is much more flexible, and can provide more services, than
init.
On UNIX and Linux systems, we can obtain a listing of processes by using
the ps command. For example, the command
ps -el
will list complete information for all processes currently active in the system.
A process tree similar to the one shown in Figure 3.7 can be constructed by
recursively tracing parent processes all the way to the systemd process. (In
addition, Linux systems provide the pstree command, which displays a tree
of all processes in the system.)
In general, when a process creates a child process, that child process will
need certain resources (CPU time, memory, files, I/O devices) to accomplish
its task. A child process may be able to obtain its resources directly from
the operating system, or it may be constrained to a subset of the resources
of the parent process. The parent may have to partition its resources among
its children, or it may be able to share some resources (such as memory or
files) among several of its children. Restricting a child process to a subset of
the parent’s resources prevents any process from overloading the system by
creating too many child processes.
In addition to supplying various physical and logical resources, the parent
process may pass along initialization data (input) to the child process. For
example, consider a process whose function is to display the contents of a file—
say, hw1.c—on the screen of a terminal. When the process is created, it will get,
as an input from its parent process, the name of the file hw1.c. Using that file
name, it will open the file and write the contents out. It may also get the name
of the output device. Alternatively, some operating systems pass resources to
child processes. On such a system, the new process may get two open files,
hw1.c and the terminal device, and may simply transfer the datum between
the two.
When a process creates a new process, two possibilities for execution exist:
1. The parent continues to execute concurrently with its children.
2. The parent waits until some or all of its children have terminated.
There are also two address-space possibilities for the new process:
Processes
1. The child process is a duplicate of the parent process (it has the same
program and data as the parent).
2. The child process has a new program loaded into it.
To illustrate these differences, let’s first consider the UNIX operating system. In
UNIX, as we’ve seen, each process is identified by its process identifier, which
is a unique integer. A new process is created by the fork() system call. The
new process consists of a copy of the address space of the original process.
This mechanism allows the parent process to communicate easily with its child
process. Both processes (the parent and the child) continue execution at the
instruction after the fork(), with one difference: the return code for the fork()
is zero for the new (child) process, whereas the (nonzero) process identifier of
the child is returned to the parent.
After a fork() system call, one of the two processes typically uses the
exec() system call to replace the process’s memory space with a new pro-
gram. The exec() system call loads a binary file into memory (destroying the
memory image of the program containing the exec() system call) and starts
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
pid t pid;
/* fork a child process */
pid = fork();
if (pid < 0) { /* error occurred */
fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed");
return 1;
}
else if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
execlp("/bin/ls","ls",NULL);
}
else { /* parent process */
/* parent will wait for the child to complete */
wait(NULL);
printf("Child Complete");
}
return 0;
}
Figure 3.8

## 3.3 Operations on Processes

its execution. In this manner, the two processes are able to communicate and
then go their separate ways. The parent can then create more children; or, if it
has nothing else to do while the child runs, it can issue a wait() system call
to move itself off the ready queue until the termination of the child. Because
the call to exec() overlays the process’s address space with a new program,
exec() does not return control unless an error occurs.
The C program shown in Figure 3.8 illustrates the UNIX system calls pre-
viously described. We now have two different processes running copies of the
same program. The only difference is that the value of the variable pid for the
child process is zero, while that for the parent is an integer value greater than
zero (in fact, it is the actual pid of the child process). The child process inherits
privileges and scheduling attributes from the parent, as well certain resources,
such as open files. The child process then overlays its address space with the
UNIX command /bin/ls (used to get a directory listing) using the execlp()
system call (execlp() is a version of the exec() system call). The parent waits
for the child process to complete with the wait() system call. When the child
process completes (by either implicitly or explicitly invoking exit()), the par-
ent process resumes from the call to wait(), where it completes using the
exit() system call. This is also illustrated in Figure 3.9.
Of course, there is nothing to prevent the child from not invoking exec()
and instead continuing to execute as a copy of the parent process. In this
scenario, the parent and child are concurrent processes running the same code
instructions. Because the child is a copy of the parent, each process has its own
copy of any data.
As an alternative example, we next consider process creation in Windows.
Processes are created in the Windows API using the CreateProcess() func-
tion, which is similar to fork() in that a parent creates a new child process.
However, whereas fork() has the child process inheriting the address space
of its parent, CreateProcess() requires loading a specified program into the
address space of the child process at process creation. Furthermore, whereas
fork() is passed no parameters, CreateProcess() expects no fewer than ten
parameters.
The C program shown in Figure 3.10 illustrates the CreateProcess()
function, which creates a child process that loads the application mspaint.exe.
We opt for many of the default values of the ten parameters passed to Cre-
ateProcess(). Readers interested in pursuing the details of process creation
and management in the Windows API are encouraged to consult the biblio-
graphical notes at the end of this chapter.
The two parameters passed to the CreateProcess() function are
instances of the
STARTUPINFO and PROCESS INFORMATION structures.
STARTUPINFO specifies many properties of the new process, such as window

size and appearance and handles to standard input and output files. The
PROCESS INFORMATION structure contains a handle and the identifiers to
the newly created process and its thread. We invoke the ZeroMemory()
function to allocate memory for each of these structures before proceeding
with CreateProcess().
The first two parameters passed to CreateProcess() are the application
name and command-line parameters. If the application name is NULL (as it
is in this case), the command-line parameter specifies the application to load.


## 3.3 Operations on Processes
> id: ch03-3-3 | src: book 3.3 | kind: concept

In this instance, we are loading the Microsoft Windows mspaint.exe appli-
cation. Beyond these two initial parameters, we use the default parameters for
inheriting process and thread handles as well as specifying that there will be no
creation flags. We also use the parent’s existing environment block and starting
directory. Last, we provide two pointers to the STARTUPINFO and PROCESS -
INFORMATION structures created at the beginning of the program. In Figure
3.8, the parent process waits for the child to complete by invoking the wait()
system call. The equivalent of this in Windows is WaitForSingleObject(),
which is passed a handle of the child process—pi.hProcess—and waits for
this process to complete. Once the child process exits, control returns from the
WaitForSingleObject() function in the parent process.
Process Termination
A process terminates when it finishes executing its final statement and asks
the operating system to delete it by using the exit() system call. At that
point, the process may return a status value (typically an integer) to its waiting
parent process (via the wait() system call). All the resources of the process
—including physical and virtual memory, open files, and I/O buffers—are
deallocated and reclaimed by the operating system.
Termination can occur in other circumstances as well. A process can cause
the termination of another process via an appropriate system call (for example,
TerminateProcess() in Windows). Usually, such a system call can be invoked
only by the parent of the process that is to be terminated. Otherwise, a user—
or a misbehaving application—could arbitrarily kill another user’s processes.
Note that a parent needs to know the identities of its children if it is to terminate
them. Thus, when one process creates a new process, the identity of the newly
created process is passed to the parent.
A parent may terminate the execution of one of its children for a variety of
reasons, such as these:
• The child has exceeded its usage of some of the resources that it has been
allocated. (To determine whether this has occurred, the parent must have
a mechanism to inspect the state of its children.)
• The task assigned to the child is no longer required.
• The parent is exiting, and the operating system does not allow a child to
continue if its parent terminates.
Some systems do not allow a child to exist if its parent has terminated.
In such systems, if a process terminates (either normally or abnormally), then
all its children must also be terminated. This phenomenon, referred to as
cascading termination, is normally initiated by the operating system.
To illustrate process execution and termination, consider that, in Linux and
UNIX systems, we can terminate a process by using the exit() system call,
providing an exit status as a parameter:
/* exit with status 1 */
exit(1);
Processes
In fact, under normal termination, exit() will be called either directly (as
shown above) or indirectly, as the C run-time library (which is added to UNIX
executable files) will include a call to exit() by default.
A parent process may wait for the termination of a child process by using
the wait() system call. The wait() system call is passed a parameter that
allows the parent to obtain the exit status of the child. This system call also
returns the process identifier of the terminated child so that the parent can tell
which of its children has terminated:
pid t pid;
int status;
pid = wait(&status);
When a process terminates, its resources are deallocated by the operating
system. However, its entry in the process table must remain there until the
parent calls wait(), because the process table contains the process’s exit status.
A process that has terminated, but whose parent has not yet called wait(), is
known as a zombie process. All processes transition to this state when they
terminate, but generally they exist as zombies only briefly. Once the parent
calls wait(), the process identifier of the zombie process and its entry in the
process table are released.
Now consider what would happen if a parent did not invoke wait() and
instead terminated, thereby leaving its child processes as orphans. Traditional
UNIX systems addressed this scenario by assigning the init process as the new
parent to orphan processes. (Recall from Section 3.3.1 that init serves as the
root of the process hierarchy in UNIX systems.) The init process periodically
invokes wait(), thereby allowing the exit status of any orphaned process to be
collected and releasing the orphan’s process identifier and process-table entry.
Although most Linux systems have replaced init with systemd, the latter
process can still serve the same role, although Linux also allows processes other
than systemd to inherit orphan processes and manage their termination.
Android Process Hierarchy
Because of resource constraints such as limited memory, mobile operating
systems may have to terminate existing processes to reclaim limited system
resources. Rather than terminating an arbitrary process, Android has identified
an importance hierarchy of processes, and when the system must terminate
a process to make resources available for a new, or more important, process,
it terminates processes in order of increasing importance. From most to least
important, the hierarchy of process classifications is as follows:
• Foreground process—The current process visible on the screen, represent-
ing the application the user is currently interacting with
• Visible process—A process that is not directly visible on the foreground
but that is performing an activity that the foreground process is referring
to (that is, a process performing an activity whose status is displayed on
the foreground process)


## 3.4 Interprocess Communication
> id: ch03-3-4 | src: book 3.4; slides 29-50 | kind: concept

• Service process—A process that is similar to a background process but
is performing an activity that is apparent to the user (such as streaming
music)
• Background process—A process that may be performing an activity but
is not apparent to the user.
• Empty process—A process that holds no active components associated
with any application
If system resources must be reclaimed, Android will first terminate empty
processes, followed by background processes, and so forth. Processes are
assigned an importance ranking, and Android attempts to assign a process as
high a ranking as possible. For example, if a process is providing a service and
is also visible, it will be assigned the more-important visible classification.
Furthermore, Android development practices suggest following the guide-
lines of the process life cycle. When these guidelines are followed, the state of
a process will be saved prior to termination and resumed at its saved state if
the user navigates back to the application.


- Processes within a system may be independent or cooperating
- Cooperating process can affect or be affected by other processes, including sharing data
- Reasons for cooperating processes:
  - Information sharing
  - Computation speedup
  - Modularity
  - Convenience
- Cooperating processes need interprocess communication (IPC)
- Two models of IPC
  - Shared memory
  - Message passing


**Communications Models**

- (a) Shared memory.  		(b) Message passing.

**Producer-Consumer Problem**

- Paradigm for cooperating processes:
  - producer process produces information that is consumed by a consumer process
- Two variations:
  - unbounded-buffer places no practical limit on the size of the buffer:
    - Producer never waits
    - Consumer waits if there is no buffer to consume
  - bounded-buffer assumes that there is a fixed buffer size
    - Producer must wait if all buffers are full
    - Consumer waits if there is no buffer to consume


**IPC – Shared Memory**

- An area of memory shared among the processes that wish to communicate
- The communication is under the control of the users processes not the operating system.
- Major issues is to provide mechanism that will allow the user processes to synchronize their actions when they access shared memory.
- Synchronization is discussed in great details in Chapters 6 & 7.


**Bounded-Buffer – Shared-Memory Solution**

- Shared data
      - #define BUFFER_SIZE 10
      - typedef struct {
      - . . .
      - } item;
      - item buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
      - int in = 0;
      - int out = 0;
- Solution is correct, but can only use BUFFER_SIZE-1 elements


**Producer Process – Shared Memory**

- item next_produced;
- while (true) {
- /* produce an item in next produced */
- while (((in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE) == out)
- ; /* do nothing */
- buffer[in] = next_produced;
- in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
- }


**Consumer Process – Shared Memory**

- item next_consumed;
- while (true) {	while (in == out)
- ; /* do nothing */	next_consumed = buffer[out];
- out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
- /* consume the item in next consumed */
- }


**What about Filling all the Buffers?**

- Suppose that we wanted to provide a solution to the consumer-producer problem that fills all the buffers.
- We can do so by having an integer counter that keeps track of the number of full buffers.
- Initially, counter is set to 0.
- The integer counter is incremented by the producer after it produces a new buffer.
- The integer counter is and is decremented by the consumer after it consumes a buffer.


**Producer**

- while (true) {	/* produce an item in next produced */
- while (counter == BUFFER_SIZE)
- ; /* do nothing */
- buffer[in] = next_produced;
- in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
- counter++;
- }


**Consumer**

- while (true) {
- while (counter == 0)
- ; /* do nothing */
- next_consumed = buffer[out];
- out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
- counter--;
- /* consume the item in next consumed */
- }


**Race Condition**

- counter++ could be implemented as     register1 = counter     register1 = register1 + 1     counter = register1
- counter-- could be implemented as     register2 = counter     register2 = register2 - 1     counter = register2
- Consider this execution interleaving with “count = 5” initially:
  - S0: producer execute register1 = counter         {register1 = 5}S1: producer execute register1 = register1 + 1   {register1 = 6} S2: consumer execute register2 = counter        {register2 = 5} S3: consumer execute register2 = register2 – 1  {register2 = 4} S4: producer execute counter = register1         {counter = 6 } S5: consumer execute counter = register2        {counter = 4}


**Race Condition (Cont.)**

- Question – why was there no race condition in the first solution (where at most N – 1) buffers can be filled?
- More in Chapter 6.


**IPC – Message Passing**

- Processes communicate with each other without resorting to shared variables
- IPC facility provides two operations:
  - send(message)
  - receive(message)
- The message size is either fixed or variable


**Message Passing (Cont.)**

- If processes P and Q wish to communicate, they need to:
  - Establish a communication link between them
  - Exchange messages via send/receive
- Implementation issues:
  - How are links established?
  - Can a link be associated with more than two processes?
  - How many links can there be between every pair of communicating processes?
  - What is the capacity of a link?
  - Is the size of a message that the link can accommodate fixed or variable?
  - Is a link unidirectional or bi-directional?


**Implementation of Communication Link**

- Physical:
  - Shared memory
  - Hardware bus
  - Network
- Logical:
  - Direct or indirect
  - Synchronous or asynchronous
  - Automatic or explicit buffering


**Direct Communication**

- Processes must name each other explicitly:
  - send (P, message) – send a message to process P
  - receive(Q, message) – receive a message from process Q
- Properties of communication link
  - Links are established automatically
  - A link is associated with exactly one pair of communicating processes
  - Between each pair there exists exactly one link
  - The link may be unidirectional, but is usually bi-directional


**Indirect Communication**

- Messages are directed and received from mailboxes (also referred to as ports)
  - Each mailbox has a unique id
  - Processes can communicate only if they share a mailbox
- Properties of communication link
  - Link established only if processes share a common mailbox
  - A link may be associated with many processes
  - Each pair of processes may share several communication links
  - Link may be unidirectional or bi-directional


**Indirect Communication (Cont.)**

- Operations
  - Create a new mailbox (port)
  - Send and receive messages through mailbox
  - Delete a mailbox
- Primitives are defined as:
  - send(A, message) – send a message to mailbox A
  - receive(A, message) – receive a message from mailbox A


**Indirect Communication (Cont.)**

- Mailbox sharing
  - P1, P2, and P3 share mailbox A
  - P1, sends; P2 and P3 receive
  - Who gets the message?
- Solutions
  - Allow a link to be associated with at most two processes
  - Allow only one process at a time to execute a receive operation
  - Allow the system to select arbitrarily the receiver.  Sender is notified who the receiver was.


**Synchronization**

- Blocking is considered synchronous
  - Blocking send -- the sender is blocked until the message is received
  - Blocking receive -- the receiver is  blocked until a message is available
- Non-blocking is considered asynchronous
  - Non-blocking send -- the sender sends the message and continue
  - Non-blocking receive -- the receiver receives:
    - A valid message,  or
    - Null message
- Different combinations possible
  - If both send and receive are blocking, we have a rendezvous
- Message passing may be either blocking or non-blocking


**Producer-Consumer: Message Passing**

- Producer
- message next_produced;   while (true) {	/* produce an item in next_produced */
- send(next_produced);
- }
- Consumer
- message next_consumed;   while (true) {	 receive(next_consumed)	/* consume the item in next_consumed */  }


**Buffering**

- Queue of messages attached to the link.
- Implemented in one of three ways
  - 1.	Zero capacity – no messages are queued on a link.Sender must wait for receiver (rendezvous)
  - 2.	Bounded capacity – finite length of n messagesSender must wait if link full
  - 3.	Unbounded capacity – infinite length Sender never waits


## 3.4 Interprocess Communication
> id: ch03-3-4 | src: book 3.4 | kind: concept

Processes executing concurrently in the operating system may be either inde-
pendent processes or cooperating processes. A process is independent if it does
not share data with any other processes executing in the system. A process
is cooperating if it can affect or be affected by the other processes executing
in the system. Clearly, any process that shares data with other processes is a
cooperating process.
There are several reasons for providing an environment that allows process
cooperation:
• Information sharing. Since several applications may be interested in the
same piece of information (for instance, copying and pasting), we must
provide an environment to allow concurrent access to such information.
• Computation speedup. If we want a particular task to run faster, we must
break it into subtasks, each of which will be executing in parallel with the
others. Notice that such a speedup can be achieved only if the computer
has multiple processing cores.
• Modularity. We may want to construct the system in a modular fashion,
dividing the system functions into separate processes or threads, as we
discussed in Chapter 2.
Cooperating processes require an interprocess communication (IPC)
mechanism that will allow them to exchange data— that is, send data to
and receive data from each other. There are two fundamental models of
interprocess communication: shared memory and message passing. In the
shared-memory model, a region of memory that is shared by the cooperating
processes is established. Processes can then exchange information by reading
and writing data to the shared region. In the message-passing model,

MULTIPROCESS ARCHITECTURE—CHROME BROWSER
Many websites contain active content, such as JavaScript, Flash, and HTML5
to provide a rich and dynamic web-browsing experience. Unfortunately,
these web applications may also contain software bugs, which can result in
sluggish response times and can even cause the web browser to crash. This
isn’t a big problem in a web browser that displays content from only one web-
site. But most contemporary web browsers provide tabbed browsing, which
allows a single instance of a web browser application to open several websites
at the same time, with each site in a separate tab. To switch between the dif-
ferent sites, a user need only click on the appropriate tab. This arrangement
is illustrated below:
Aproblem with this approach is that if a web application in any tab crashes,
the entire process—including all other tabs displaying additional websites—
crashes as well.
Google’s Chrome web browser was designed to address this issue by
using a multiprocess architecture. Chrome identifies three different types of
processes: browser, renderers, and plug-ins.
• The browser process is responsible for managing the user interface as
well as disk and network I/O. A new browser process is created when
Chrome is started. Only one browser process is created.
• Renderer processes contain logic for rendering web pages. Thus, they
contain the logic for handling HTML, Javascript, images, and so forth. As
a general rule, a new renderer process is created for each website opened
in a new tab, and so several renderer processes may be active at the same
time.
• A plug-in process is created for each type of plug-in (such as Flash or
QuickTime) in use. Plug-in processes contain the code for the plug-in as
well as additional code that enables the plug-in to communicate with
associated renderer processes and the browser process.
The advantage of the multiprocess approach is that websites run in iso-
lation from one another. If one website crashes, only its renderer process is
affected; all other processes remain unharmed. Furthermore, renderer pro-
cesses run in a sandbox, which means that access to disk and network I/O is
restricted, minimizing the effects of any security exploits.
communication takes place by means of messages exchanged between the
cooperating processes. The two communications models are contrasted in
Figure 3.11.

Communications models. (a) Shared memory. (b) Message passing.
Both of the models just mentioned are common in operating systems,
and many systems implement both. Message passing is useful for exchanging
smaller amounts of data, because no conflicts need be avoided. Message pass-
ing is also easier to implement in a distributed system than shared memory.
(Although there are systems that provide distributed shared memory, we do
not consider them in this text.) Shared memory can be faster than message pass-
ing, since message-passing systems are typically implemented using system
calls and thus require the more time-consuming task of kernel intervention.
In shared-memory systems, system calls are required only to establish shared-
memory regions. Once shared memory is established, all accesses are treated
as routine memory accesses, and no assistance from the kernel is required.
In Section 3.5 and Section 3.6 we explore shared-memory and message-
passing systems in more detail.


## 3.5 IPC in Shared-Memory Systems
> id: ch03-3-5 | src: book 3.5 | kind: concept

Interprocess communication using shared memory requires communicating
processes to establish a region of shared memory. Typically, a shared-memory
region resides in the address space of the process creating the shared-memory
segment. Other processes that wish to communicate using this shared-memory
segment must attach it to their address space. Recall that, normally, the oper-
ating system tries to prevent one process from accessing another process’s
memory. Shared memory requires that two or more processes agree to remove
this restriction. They can then exchange information by reading and writing
data in the shared areas. The form of the data and the location are determined
by these processes and are not under the operating system’s control. The pro-
cesses are also responsible for ensuring that they are not writing to the same
location simultaneously.
Processes
To illustrate the concept of cooperating processes, let’s consider the pro-
ducer–consumer problem, which is a common paradigm for cooperating pro-
cesses. A producer process produces information that is consumed by a con-
sumer process. For example, a compiler may produce assembly code that is
consumed by an assembler. The assembler, in turn, may produce object mod-
ules that are consumed by the loader. The producer–consumer problem also
provides a useful metaphor for the client–server paradigm. We generally think
of a server as a producer and a client as a consumer. For example, a web server
produces (that is, provides) web content such as HTML files and images, which
are consumed (that is, read) by the client web browser requesting the resource.
One solution to the producer–consumer problem uses shared memory. To
allow producer and consumer processes to run concurrently, we must have
available a buffer of items that can be filled by the producer and emptied by
the consumer. This buffer will reside in a region of memory that is shared by
the producer and consumer processes. A producer can produce one item while
the consumer is consuming another item. The producer and consumer must be
synchronized, so that the consumer does not try to consume an item that has
not yet been produced.
Two types of buffers can be used. The unbounded buffer places no prac-
tical limit on the size of the buffer. The consumer may have to wait for new
items, but the producer can always produce new items. The bounded buffer
assumes a fixed buffer size. In this case, the consumer must wait if the buffer
is empty, and the producer must wait if the buffer is full.
Let’s look more closely at how the bounded buffer illustrates interprocess
communication using shared memory. The following variables reside in a
region of memory shared by the producer and consumer processes:
#define BUFFER SIZE 10
typedef struct {
. . .
} item;
item buffer[BUFFER SIZE];
int in = 0;
int out = 0;
The shared buffer is implemented as a circular array with two logical pointers:
in and out. The variable in points to the next free position in the buffer; out
points to the first full position in the buffer. The buffer is empty when in ==
out; the buffer is full when ((in + 1) % BUFFER SIZE) == out.
The code for the producer process is shown in Figure 3.12, and the code for
the consumer process is shown in Figure 3.13. The producer process has a local
variable next produced in which the new item to be produced is stored. The
consumer process has a local variable next consumed in which the item to be
consumed is stored.
This scheme allows at most BUFFER SIZE −1 items in the buffer at the
same time. We leave it as an exercise for you to provide a solution in which
BUFFER SIZE items can be in the buffer at the same time. In Section 3.7.1, we
illustrate the POSIX API for shared memory.

item next produced;
while (true) {
/* produce an item in next produced */
while (((in + 1) % BUFFER SIZE) == out)
; /* do nothing */
buffer[in] = next produced;
in = (in + 1) % BUFFER SIZE;
}
Figure 3.12
The producer process using shared memory.
One issue this illustration does not address concerns the situation in which
both the producer process and the consumer process attempt to access the
shared buffer concurrently. In Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, we discuss how syn-
chronization among cooperating processes can be implemented effectively in
a shared-memory environment.


## 3.6 IPC in Message-Passing Systems
> id: ch03-3-6 | src: book 3.6 | kind: concept

In Section 3.5, we showed how cooperating processes can communicate in a
shared-memory environment. The scheme requires that these processes share a
region of memory and that the code for accessing and manipulating the shared
memory be written explicitly by the application programmer. Another way to
achieve the same effect is for the operating system to provide the means for
cooperating processes to communicate with each other via a message-passing
facility.
item next consumed;
while (true) {
while (in == out)
; /* do nothing */
next consumed = buffer[out];
out = (out + 1) % BUFFER SIZE;
/* consume the item in next consumed */
}

The consumer process using shared memory.
Processes
Message passing provides a mechanism to allow processes to communicate
and to synchronize their actions without sharing the same address space. It
is particularly useful in a distributed environment, where the communicating
processes may reside on different computers connected by a network. For
example, an Internet chat program could be designed so that chat participants
communicate with one another by exchanging messages.
A message-passing facility provides at least two operations:
send(message)
and
receive(message)
Messages sent by a process can be either fixed or variable in size. If only
fixed-sized messages can be sent, the system-level implementation is straight-
forward. This restriction, however, makes the task of programming more diffi-
cult. Conversely, variable-sized messages require a more complex system-level
implementation, but the programming task becomes simpler. This is a common
kind of tradeoff seen throughout operating-system design.
If processes P and Q want to communicate, they must send messages to and
receive messages from each other: a communication link must exist between
them. This link can be implemented in a variety of ways. We are concerned here
not with the link’s physical implementation (such as shared memory, hardware
bus, or network, which are covered in Chapter 19) but rather with its logical
implementation. Here are several methods for logically implementing a link
and the send()/receive() operations:
• Direct or indirect communication
• Synchronous or asynchronous communication
• Automatic or explicit buffering
We look at issues related to each of these features next.
Naming
Processes that want to communicate must have a way to refer to each other.
They can use either direct or indirect communication.
Under direct communication, each process that wants to communicate
must explicitly name the recipient or sender of the communication. In this
scheme, the send() and receive() primitives are defined as:
• send(P, message)—Send a message to process P.
• receive(Q, message)—Receive a message from process Q.
A communication link in this scheme has the following properties:
• A link is established automatically between every pair of processes that
want to communicate. The processes need to know only each other’s
identity to communicate.


## 3.6 IPC in Message-Passing Systems
> id: ch03-3-6 | src: book 3.6 | kind: concept

• A link is associated with exactly two processes.
• Between each pair of processes, there exists exactly one link.
This scheme exhibits symmetry in addressing; that is, both the sender pro-
cess and the receiver process must name the other to communicate. A variant
of this scheme employs asymmetry in addressing. Here, only the sender names
the recipient; the recipient is not required to name the sender. In this scheme,
the send() and receive() primitives are defined as follows:
• send(P, message)—Send a message to process P.
• receive(id, message)—Receive a message from any process. The vari-
able id is set to the name of the process with which communication has
taken place.
The disadvantage in both of these schemes (symmetric and asymmetric)
is the limited modularity of the resulting process definitions. Changing the
identifier of a process may necessitate examining all other process definitions.
All references to the old identifier must be found, so that they can be modified
to the new identifier. In general, any such hard-coding techniques, where iden-
tifiers must be explicitly stated, are less desirable than techniques involving
indirection, as described next.
With indirect communication, the messages are sent to and received from
mailboxes, or ports. A mailbox can be viewed abstractly as an object into
which messages can be placed by processes and from which messages can
be removed. Each mailbox has a unique identification. For example, POSIX
message queues use an integer value to identify a mailbox. A process can com-
municate with another process via a number of different mailboxes, but two
processes can communicate only if they have a shared mailbox. The send()
and receive() primitives are defined as follows:
• send(A, message)—Send a message to mailbox A.
• receive(A, message)—Receive a message from mailbox A.
In this scheme, a communication link has the following properties:
• A link is established between a pair of processes only if both members of
the pair have a shared mailbox.
• A link may be associated with more than two processes.
• Between each pair of communicating processes, a number of different links
may exist, with each link corresponding to one mailbox.
Now suppose that processes P1, P2, and P3 all share mailbox A. Process P1
sends a message to A, while both P2 and P3 execute a receive() from A. Which
process will receive the message sent by P1? The answer depends on which of
the following methods we choose:
• Allow a link to be associated with two processes at most.
Processes
• Allow at most one process at a time to execute a receive() operation.
• Allow the system to select arbitrarily which process will receive the mes-
sage (that is, either P2 or P3, but not both, will receive the message). The
system may define an algorithm for selecting which process will receive
the message (for example, round robin, where processes take turns receiv-
ing messages). The system may identify the receiver to the sender.
A mailbox may be owned either by a process or by the operating system.
If the mailbox is owned by a process (that is, the mailbox is part of the address
space of the process), then we distinguish between the owner (which can
only receive messages through this mailbox) and the user (which can only
send messages to the mailbox). Since each mailbox has a unique owner, there
can be no confusion about which process should receive a message sent to
this mailbox. When a process that owns a mailbox terminates, the mailbox
disappears. Any process that subsequently sends a message to this mailbox
must be notified that the mailbox no longer exists.
In contrast, a mailbox that is owned by the operating system has an exis-
tence of its own. It is independent and is not attached to any particular process.
The operating system then must provide a mechanism that allows a process to
do the following:
• Create a new mailbox.
• Send and receive messages through the mailbox.
• Delete a mailbox.
The process that creates a new mailbox is that mailbox’s owner by default.
Initially, the owner is the only process that can receive messages through this
mailbox. However, the ownership and receiving privilege may be passed to
other processes through appropriate system calls. Of course, this provision
could result in multiple receivers for each mailbox.
Synchronization
Communication between processes takes place through calls to send() and
receive() primitives. There are different design options for implementing
each primitive. Message passing may be either blocking or nonblocking—
also known as synchronous and asynchronous. (Throughout this text, you will
encounter the concepts of synchronous and asynchronous behavior in relation
to various operating-system algorithms.)
• Blocking send. The sending process is blocked until the message is
received by the receiving process or by the mailbox.
• Nonblocking send. The sending process sends the message and resumes
operation.
• Blocking receive. The receiver blocks until a message is available.
• Nonblocking receive. The receiver retrieves either a valid message or a
null.

message next produced;
while (true) {
/* produce an item in next produced */
send(next produced);
}
Figure 3.14
The producer process using message passing.
Different combinations of send() and receive() are possible. When both
send() and receive() are blocking, we have a rendezvous between the
sender and the receiver. The solution to the producer–consumer problem
becomes trivial when we use blocking send() and receive() statements. The
producer merely invokes the blocking send() call and waits until the message
is delivered to either the receiver or the mailbox. Likewise, when the consumer
invokes receive(), it blocks until a message is available. This is illustrated in
Figures 3.14 and 3.15.
Buffering
Whether communication is direct or indirect, messages exchanged by commu-
nicating processes reside in a temporary queue. Basically, such queues can be
implemented in three ways:
• Zero capacity. The queue has a maximum length of zero; thus, the link
cannot have any messages waiting in it. In this case, the sender must block
until the recipient receives the message.
• Bounded capacity. The queue has finite length n; thus, at most n messages
can reside in it. If the queue is not full when a new message is sent, the
message is placed in the queue (either the message is copied or a pointer
to the message is kept), and the sender can continue execution without
message next consumed;
while (true) {
receive(next consumed);
/* consume the item in next consumed */
}
Figure 3.15

Processes
waiting. The link’s capacity is finite, however. If the link is full, the sender
must block until space is available in the queue.
• Unbounded capacity. The queue’s length is potentially infinite; thus, any
number of messages can wait in it. The sender never blocks.
The zero-capacity case is sometimes referred to as a message system with no
buffering. The other cases are referred to as systems with automatic buffering.


## 3.7 Examples of IPC Systems
> id: ch03-3-7 | src: book 3.7; slides 51-71 | kind: concept

In this section, we explore four different IPC systems. We first cover the POSIX
API for shared memory and then discuss message passing in the Mach oper-
ating system. Next, we present Windows IPC, which interestingly uses shared
memory as a mechanism for providing certain types of message passing. We
conclude with pipes, one of the earliest IPC mechanisms on UNIX systems.
POSIX Shared Memory
Several IPC mechanisms are available for POSIX systems, including shared
memory and message passing. Here, we explore the POSIX API for shared
memory.
POSIX shared memory is organized using memory-mapped files, which
associate the region of shared memory with a file. A process must first create
a shared-memory object using the shm open() system call, as follows:
fd = shm open(name, O CREAT | O RDWR, 0666);
The first parameter specifies the name of the shared-memory object. Processes
that wish to access this shared memory must refer to the object by this name.
The subsequent parameters specify that the shared-memory object is to be cre-
ated if it does not yet exist (O CREAT) and that the object is open for reading and
writing (O RDWR). The last parameter establishes the file-access permissions of
the shared-memory object. A successful call to shm open() returns an integer
file descriptor for the shared-memory object.
Once the object is established, the ftruncate() function is used to
configure the size of the object in bytes. The call
ftruncate(fd, 4096);
sets the size of the object to 4,096 bytes.
Finally, the mmap() function establishes a memory-mapped file containing
the shared-memory object. It also returns a pointer to the memory-mapped file
that is used for accessing the shared-memory object.
The programs shown in Figure 3.16 and Figure 3.17 use the producer–
consumer model in implementing shared memory. The producer establishes a
shared-memory object and writes to shared memory, and the consumer reads
from shared memory.


**Examples of IPC Systems - POSIX**

- POSIX Shared Memory
  - Process first creates shared memory segmentshm_fd = shm_open(name, O CREAT | O RDWR, 0666);
  - Also used to open an existing segment
  - Set the size of the object
- ftruncate(shm_fd, 4096);
  - Use mmap() to memory-map a file pointer to the shared memory object
  - Reading and writing to shared memory is done by using the pointer returned by mmap().

  - Each task gets two ports at creation  - Kernel and Notify
  - Messages are sent and received using the mach_msg() function
  - Ports needed for communication, created via
  - mach_port_allocate()
  - Send and receive are flexible; for example four options if mailbox full:
    - Wait indefinitely
    - Wait at most n milliseconds
    - Return immediately
    - Temporarily cache a message

**Examples of IPC Systems – Windows**

- Message-passing centric via advanced local procedure call (LPC) facility
  - Only works between processes on the same system
  - Uses ports (like mailboxes) to establish and maintain communication channels
  - Communication works as follows:
    - The client opens a handle to the subsystem’s connection port object.
    - The client sends a connection request.
    - The server creates two private communication ports and returns the handle to one of them to the client.
    - The client and server use the corresponding port handle to send messages or callbacks and to listen for replies.

**Pipes**

- Acts as a conduit allowing two processes to communicate
- Issues:
  - Is communication unidirectional or bidirectional?
  - In the case of two-way communication, is it half or full-duplex?
  - Must there exist a relationship (i.e., parent-child) between the communicating processes?
  - Can the pipes be used over a network?
- Ordinary pipes – cannot be accessed  from outside the process that created it. Typically, a parent process creates a pipe and uses it to communicate with a child process that it created.
- Named pipes – can be accessed without a parent-child relationship.


**Ordinary Pipes**

- Ordinary Pipes allow communication in standard producer-consumer style
- Producer writes to one end (the write-end of the pipe)
- Consumer reads from the other end (the read-end of the pipe)
- Ordinary pipes are therefore unidirectional
- Require parent-child relationship between communicating processes
- Windows calls these anonymous pipes

**Named Pipes**

- Named Pipes are more powerful than ordinary pipes
- Communication is bidirectional
- No parent-child relationship is necessary between the communicating processes
- Several processes can use the named pipe for communication
- Provided on both UNIX and Windows systems


**Communications in Client-Server Systems**

- Sockets
- Remote Procedure Calls


**Sockets**

- A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication
- Concatenation of IP address and port – a number included at start of message packet to differentiate network services on a host
- The socket 161.25.19.8:1625 refers to port 1625 on host 161.25.19.8
- Communication consists between a pair of sockets
- All ports below 1024 are well known, used for standard services
- Special IP address 127.0.0.1 (loopback) to refer to system on which process is running

**Sockets in Java**

- Three types of sockets
  - Connection-oriented (TCP)
  - Connectionless (UDP)
  - MulticastSocket class– data can be sent to multiple recipients
- Consider this “Date” server in Java:

**Remote Procedure Calls**

- Remote procedure call (RPC) abstracts procedure calls between processes on networked systems
  - Again uses ports for service differentiation
- Stubs – client-side proxy for the actual procedure on the server
- The client-side stub locates the server and marshalls the parameters
- The server-side stub receives this message, unpacks the marshalled parameters, and performs the procedure on the server
- On Windows, stub code compile from specification written in Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL)


**Remote Procedure Calls (Cont.)**

- Data representation handled via External Data Representation (XDL) format to account for different architectures
  - Big-endian and little-endian
- Remote communication has more failure scenarios than local
  - Messages can be delivered exactly once rather than at most once
- OS typically provides a rendezvous (or matchmaker) service to connect client and server

Processes
The producer, shown in Figure 3.16, creates a shared-memory object named
OS and writes the infamous string "Hello World!" to shared memory. The
program memory-maps a shared-memory object of the specified size and
allows writing to the object. The flag MAP SHARED specifies that changes to the
shared-memory object will be visible to all processes sharing the object. Notice
that we write to the shared-memory object by calling the sprintf() function
and writing the formatted string to the pointer ptr. After each write, we must
increment the pointer by the number of bytes written.

The consumer process, shown in Figure 3.17, reads and outputs the con-
tents of the shared memory. The consumer also invokes the shm unlink()
function, which removes the shared-memory segment after the consumer has
accessed it. We provide further exercises using the POSIX shared-memory API in
the programming exercises at the end of this chapter. Additionally, we provide
more detailed coverage of memory mapping in Section 13.5.
Mach Message Passing
As an example of message passing, we next consider the Mach operating
system. Mach was especially designed for distributed systems, but was shown
to be suitable for desktop and mobile systems as well, as evidenced by its
inclusion in the macOS and iOS operating systems, as discussed in Chapter 2.
The Mach kernel supports the creation and destruction of multiple tasks,
which are similar to processes but have multiple threads of control and
fewer associated resources. Most communication in Mach—including all inter-
task communication—is carried out by messages. Messages are sent to, and
received from, mailboxes, which are called ports in Mach. Ports are finite in size
and unidirectional; for two-way communication, a message is sent to one port,
and a response is sent to a separate reply port. Each port may have multiple
senders, but only one receiver. Mach uses ports to represent resources such
as tasks, threads, memory, and processors, while message passing provides
an object-oriented approach for interacting with these system resources and
services. Message passing may occur between any two ports on the same host
or on separate hosts on a distributed system.
Associated with each port is a collection of port rights that identify
the capabilities necessary for a task to interact with the port. For example,
for a task to receive a message from a port, it must have the capability
MACH PORT RIGHT RECEIVE for that port. The task that creates a port is that
port’s owner, and the owner is the only task that is allowed to receive messages
from that port. A port’s owner may also manipulate the capabilities for a port.
This is most commonly done in establishing a reply port. For example, assume
that task T1 owns port P1, and it sends a message to port P2, which is owned
by task T2. If T1 expects to receive a reply from T2, it must grant T2 the
right MACH PORT RIGHT SEND for port P1. Ownership of port rights is at the
task level, which means that all threads belonging to the same task share the
same port rights. Thus, two threads belonging to the same task can easily
communicate by exchanging messages through the per-thread port associated
with each thread.
When a task is created, two special ports—the Task Self port and the
Notify port—are also created. The kernel has receive rights to the Task Self
port, which allows a task to send messages to the kernel. The kernel can send
notification of event occurrences to a task’s Notify port (to which, of course,
the task has receive rights).
The mach port allocate() function call creates a new port and allocates
space for its queue of messages. It also identifies the rights for the port. Each
port right represents a name for that port, and a port can only be accessed via
Processes
a right. Port names are simple integer values and behave much like UNIX file
descriptors. The following example illustrates creating a port using this API:
mach port t port; // the name of the port right
mach port allocate(
mach task self(), // a task referring to itself
MACH PORT RIGHT RECEIVE, // the right for this port
&port); // the name of the port right
Each task also has access to a bootstrap port, which allows a task to register
a port it has created with a system-wide bootstrap server. Once a port has been
registered with the bootstrap server, other tasks can look up the port in this
registry and obtain rights for sending messages to the port.
The queue associated with each port is finite in size and is initially empty.
As messages are sent to the port, the messages are copied into the queue. All
messages are delivered reliably and have the same priority. Mach guarantees
that multiple messages from the same sender are queued in first-in, first-
out (FIFO) order but does not guarantee an absolute ordering. For instance,
messages from two senders may be queued in any order.
Mach messages contain the following two fields:
• A fixed-size message header containing metadata about the message,
including the size of the message as well as source and destination ports.
Commonly, the sending thread expects a reply, so the port name of the
source is passed on to the receiving task, which can use it as a “return
address” in sending a reply.
• A variable-sized body containing data.
Messages may be either simple or complex. A simple message contains
ordinary, unstructured user data that are not interpreted by the kernel. A
complex message may contain pointers to memory locations containing data
(known as “out-of-line” data) or may also be used for transferring port rights
to another task. Out-of-line data pointers are especially useful when a message
must pass large chunks of data. A simple message would require copying and
packaging the data in the message; out-of-line data transmission requires only
a pointer that refers to the memory location where the data are stored.
The function mach msg() is the standard API for both sending and
receiving messages. The value of one of the function’s parameters—either
MACH SEND MSG or MACH RCV MSG—indicates if it is a send or receive operation.
We now illustrate how it is used when a client task sends a simple message to
a server task. Assume there are two ports—client and server—associated
with the client and server tasks, respectively. The code in Figure 3.18 shows
the client task constructing a header and sending a message to the server, as
well as the server task receiving the message sent from the client.
The mach msg() function call is invoked by user programs for performing
message passing. mach msg() then invokes the function mach msg trap(),
which is a system call to the Mach kernel. Within the kernel, mach msg trap()
next calls the function mach msg overwrite trap(), which then handles the
actual passing of the message.

Example program illustrating message passing in Mach.
The send and receive operations themselves are flexible. For instance, when
a message is sent to a port, its queue may be full. If the queue is not full,
the message is copied to the queue, and the sending task continues. If the
Processes
port’s queue is full, the sender has several options (specified via parameters
to mach msg():
1. Wait indefinitely until there is room in the queue.
2. Wait at most n milliseconds.
3. Do not wait at all but rather return immediately.
4. Temporarily cache a message. Here, a message is given to the operating
system to keep, even though the queue to which that message is being
sent is full. When the message can be put in the queue, a notification
message is sent back to the sender. Only one message to a full queue can
be pending at any time for a given sending thread.
The final option is meant for server tasks. After finishing a request, a server
task may need to send a one-time reply to the task that requested the service,
but it must also continue with other service requests, even if the reply port for
a client is full.
The major problem with message systems has generally been poor perfor-
mance caused by copying of messages from the sender’s port to the receiver’s
port. The Mach message system attempts to avoid copy operations by using
virtual-memory-management techniques (Chapter 10). Essentially, Mach maps
the address space containing the sender’s message into the receiver’s address
space. Therefore, the message itself is never actually copied, as both the sender
and receiver access the same memory. This message-management technique
provides a large performance boost but works only for intrasystem messages.
Windows
The Windows operating system is an example of modern design that employs
modularity to increase functionality and decrease the time needed to imple-
ment new features. Windows provides support for multiple operating envi-
ronments, or subsystems. Application programs communicate with these sub-
systems via a message-passing mechanism. Thus, application programs can be
considered clients of a subsystem server.
The message-passing facility in Windows is called the advanced local pro-
cedure call (ALPC) facility. It is used for communication between two processes
on the same machine. It is similar to the standard remote procedure call (RPC)
mechanism that is widely used, but it is optimized for and specific to Windows.
(Remote procedure calls are covered in detail in Section 3.8.2.) Like Mach, Win-
dows uses a port object to establish and maintain a connection between two
processes. Windows uses two types of ports: connection ports and communi-
cation ports.
Server processes publish connection-port objects that are visible to all pro-
cesses. When a client wants services from a subsystem, it opens a handle to the
server’s connection-port object and sends a connection request to that port.
The server then creates a channel and returns a handle to the client. The chan-
nel consists of a pair of private communication ports: one for client–server
messages, the other for server–client messages. Additionally, communication
channels support a callback mechanism that allows the client and server to
accept requests when they would normally be expecting a reply.

When an ALPC channel is created, one of three message-passing techniques
is chosen:
1. For small messages (up to 256 bytes), the port’s message queue is used
as intermediate storage, and the messages are copied from one process to
the other.
2. Larger messages must be passed through a section object, which is a
region of shared memory associated with the channel.
3. When the amount of data is too large to fit into a section object, an API is
available that allows server processes to read and write directly into the
address space of a client.
The client has to decide when it sets up the channel whether it will need
to send a large message. If the client determines that it does want to send
large messages, it asks for a section object to be created. Similarly, if the server
decides that replies will be large, it creates a section object. So that the section
object can be used, a small message is sent that contains a pointer and size
information about the section object. This method is more complicated than the
first method listed above, but it avoids data copying. The structure of advanced
local procedure calls in Windows is shown in Figure 3.19.
It is important to note that the ALPC facility in Windows is not part of the
Windows API and hence is not visible to the application programmer. Rather,
applications using the Windows API invoke standard remote procedure calls.
When the RPC is being invoked on a process on the same system, the RPC is
handled indirectly through an ALPC procedure call. Additionally, many kernel
services use ALPC to communicate with client processes.
Pipes
A pipe acts as a conduit allowing two processes to communicate. Pipes were
one of the first IPC mechanisms in early UNIX systems. They typically pro-
vide one of the simpler ways for processes to communicate with one another,
although they also have some limitations. In implementing a pipe, four issues
must be considered:
Processes
1. Does the pipe allow bidirectional communication, or is communication
unidirectional?
2. If two-way communication is allowed, is it half duplex (data can travel
only one way at a time) or full duplex (data can travel in both directions
at the same time)?
3. Must a relationship (such as parent–child) exist between the communi-
cating processes?
4. Can the pipes communicate over a network, or must the communicating
processes reside on the same machine?
In the following sections, we explore two common types of pipes used on both
UNIX and Windows systems: ordinary pipes and named pipes.
Ordinary Pipes
Ordinary pipes allow two processes to communicate in standard producer–
consumer fashion: the producer writes to one end of the pipe (the write end)
and the consumer reads from the other end (the read end). As a result, ordinary
pipes are unidirectional, allowing only one-way communication. If two-way
communication is required, two pipes must be used, with each pipe sending
data in a different direction. We next illustrate constructing ordinary pipes
on both UNIX and Windows systems. In both program examples, one process
writes the message Greetings to the pipe, while the other process reads this
message from the pipe.
On UNIX systems, ordinary pipes are constructed using the function
pipe(int fd[])
This function creates a pipe that is accessed through the int fd[] file descrip-
tors: fd[0] is the read end of the pipe, and fd[1] is the write end. UNIX treats a
pipe as a special type of file. Thus, pipes can be accessed using ordinary read()
and write() system calls.
An ordinary pipe cannot be accessed from outside the process that created
it. Typically, a parent process creates a pipe and uses it to communicate with
a child process that it creates via fork(). Recall from Section 3.3.1 that a child
process inherits open files from its parent. Since a pipe is a special type of
file, the child inherits the pipe from its parent process. Figure 3.20 illustrates

the relationship of the file descriptors in the fd array to the parent and child
processes. As this illustrates, any writes by the parent to its write end of the
pipe—fd[1]—can be read by the child from its read end—fd[0]—of the
pipe.
In the UNIX program shown in Figure 3.21, the parent process creates a
pipe and then sends a fork() call creating the child process. What occurs
after the fork() call depends on how the data are to flow through the pipe.
In this instance, the parent writes to the pipe, and the child reads from it. It is
important to notice that both the parent process and the child process initially
close their unused ends of the pipe. Although the program shown in Figure


## 3.21 does not require this action, it is an important step to ensure that a process
> id: ch03-3-21 | src: book 3.21 | kind: concept

reading from the pipe can detect end-of-file (read() returns 0) when the writer
has closed its end of the pipe.
Ordinary pipes on Windows systems are termed anonymous pipes, and
they behave similarly to their UNIX counterparts: they are unidirectional and
employ parent–child relationships between the communicating processes. In
addition, reading and writing to the pipe can be accomplished with the ordi-
nary ReadFile() and WriteFile() functions. The Windows API for creating
pipes is the CreatePipe() function, which is passed four parameters. The
parameters provide separate handles for (1) reading and (2) writing to the pipe,
as well as (3) an instance of the STARTUPINFO structure, which is used to specify
that the child process is to inherit the handles of the pipe. Furthermore, (4) the
size of the pipe (in bytes) may be specified.
Figure 3.23 illustrates a parent process creating an anonymous pipe for
communicating with its child. Unlike UNIX systems, in which a child pro-
cess automatically inherits a pipe created by its parent, Windows requires the
programmer to specify which attributes the child process will inherit. This is

accomplished by first initializing the SECURITY ATTRIBUTES structure to allow
handles to be inherited and then redirecting the child process’s handles for
standard input or standard output to the read or write handle of the pipe. Since
the child will be reading from the pipe, the parent must redirect the child’s
standard input to the read handle of the pipe. Furthermore, as the pipes are half
duplex, it is necessary to prohibit the child from inheriting the write end of the

pipe. The program to create the child process is similar to the program in Figure
3.10, except that the fifth parameter is set to TRUE, indicating that the child
process is to inherit designated handles from its parent. Before writing to the
pipe, the parent first closes its unused read end of the pipe. The child process
that reads from the pipe is shown in Figure 3.25. Before reading from the pipe,
this program obtains the read handle to the pipe by invoking GetStdHandle().
Note that ordinary pipes require a parent–child relationship between the
communicating processes on both UNIX and Windows systems. This means
that these pipes can be used only for communication between processes on the
same machine.
Named Pipes
Ordinary pipes provide a simple mechanism for allowing a pair of processes
to communicate. However, ordinary pipes exist only while the processes are
communicating with one another. On both UNIX and Windows systems, once
the processes have finished communicating and have terminated, the ordinary
pipe ceases to exist.
Named pipes provide a much more powerful communication tool. Com-
munication can be bidirectional, and no parent–child relationship is required.
Once a named pipe is established, several processes can use it for communi-
cation. In fact, in a typical scenario, a named pipe has several writers. Addi-
tionally, named pipes continue to exist after communicating processes have
finished. Both UNIX and Windows systems support named pipes, although the
details of implementation differ greatly. Next, we explore named pipes in each
of these systems.
Named pipes are referred to as FIFOs in UNIX systems. Once created, they
appear as typical files in the file system. A FIFO is created with the mkfifo()
system call and manipulated with the ordinary open(), read(), write(),
and close() system calls. It will continue to exist until it is explicitly deleted

from the file system. Although FIFOs allow bidirectional communication, only
half-duplex transmission is permitted. If data must travel in both directions,
two FIFOs are typically used. Additionally, the communicating processes must
reside on the same machine. If intermachine communication is required, sock-
ets (Section 3.8.1) must be used.
Named pipes on Windows systems provide a richer communication mech-
anism than their UNIX counterparts. Full-duplex communication is allowed,
and the communicating processes may reside on either the same or different
machines. Additionally, only byte-oriented data may be transmitted across a
UNIX FIFO, whereas Windows systems allow either byte- or message-oriented
data. Named pipes are created with the CreateNamedPipe() function, and a
client can connect to a named pipe using ConnectNamedPipe(). Communi-
cation over the named pipe can be accomplished using the ReadFile() and
WriteFile() functions.


## 3.8 Communication in Client–Server Systems
> id: ch03-3-8 | src: book 3.8 | kind: concept

In Section 3.4, we described how processes can communicate using shared
memory and message passing. These techniques can be used for communica-
tion in client–server systems (Section 1.10.3) as well. In this section, we explore
two other strategies for communication in client–server systems: sockets and
Processes
PIPES IN PRACTICE
Pipes are used quite often in the UNIX command-line environment for situ-
ations in which the output of one command serves as input to another. For
example, the UNIX ls command produces a directory listing. For especially
long directory listings, the output may scroll through several screens. The
command less manages output by displaying only one screen of output at
a time where the user may use certain keys to move forward or backward
in the file. Setting up a pipe between the ls and less commands (which
are running as individual processes) allows the output of ls to be delivered
as the input to less, enabling the user to display a large directory listing a
screen at a time. A pipe can be constructed on the command line using the |
character. The complete command is
ls | less
In this scenario, the ls command serves as the producer, and its output is
consumed by the less command.
Windows systems provide a more command for the DOS shell with func-
tionality similar to that of its UNIX counterpart less. (UNIX systems also
provide a more command, but in the tongue-in-cheek style common in UNIX,
the less command in fact provides more functionality than more!) The DOS
shell also uses the | character for establishing a pipe. The only difference is
that to get a directory listing, DOS uses the dir command rather than ls, as
shown below:
dir | more
remote procedure calls (RPCs). As we shall see in our coverage of RPCs, not
only are they useful for client–server computing, but Android also uses remote
procedures as a form of IPC between processes running on the same system.
Sockets
Asocket is defined as an endpoint for communication. Apair of processes com-
municating over a network employs a pair of sockets—one for each process.
A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number. In
general, sockets use a client–server architecture. The server waits for incoming
client requests by listening to a specified port. Once a request is received, the
server accepts a connection from the client socket to complete the connection.
Servers implementing specific services (such as SSH, FTP, and HTTP) listen to
well-known ports (an SSH server listens to port 22; an FTP server listens to
port 21; and a web, or HTTP, server listens to port 80). All ports below 1024
are considered well known and are used to implement standard services.
When a client process initiates a request for a connection, it is assigned a
port by its host computer. This port has some arbitrary number greater than
1024. For example, if a client on host X with IP address 146.86.5.20 wishes to
establish a connection with a web server (which is listening on port 80) at

address 161.25.19.8, host X may be assigned port 1625. The connection will
consist of a pair of sockets: (146.86.5.20:1625) on host X and (161.25.19.8:80)
on the web server. This situation is illustrated in Figure 3.26. The packets
traveling between the hosts are delivered to the appropriate process based on
the destination port number.
All connections must be unique. Therefore, if another process also on host
X wished to establish another connection with the same web server, it would be
assigned a port number greater than 1024 and not equal to 1625. This ensures
that all connections consist of a unique pair of sockets.
Although most program examples in this text use C, we will illustrate
sockets using Java, as it provides a much easier interface to sockets and has
a rich library for networking utilities. Those interested in socket programming
in C or C++ should consult the bibliographical notes at the end of the chapter.
Java provides three different types of sockets. Connection-oriented (TCP)
sockets are implemented with the Socket class. Connectionless (UDP) sockets
use the DatagramSocket class. Finally, the MulticastSocket class is a sub-
class of the DatagramSocket class. A multicast socket allows data to be sent to
multiple recipients.
Our example describes a date server that uses connection-oriented TCP
sockets. The operation allows clients to request the current date and time from
the server. The server listens to port 6013, although the port could have any
arbitrary, unused number greater than 1024. When a connection is received,
the server returns the date and time to the client.
The date server is shown in Figure 3.27. The server creates a ServerSocket
that specifies that it will listen to port 6013. The server then begins listening
to the port with the accept() method. The server blocks on the accept()
method waiting for a client to request a connection. When a connection request
is received, accept() returns a socket that the server can use to communicate
with the client.
The details of how the server communicates with the socket are as follows.
The server first establishes a PrintWriter object that it will use to communi-
cate with the client. A PrintWriter object allows the server to write to the
socket using the routine print() and println() methods for output. The

server process sends the date to the client, calling the method println(). Once
it has written the date to the socket, the server closes the socket to the client and
resumes listening for more requests.
A client communicates with the server by creating a socket and connecting
to the port on which the server is listening. We implement such a client in the
Java program shown in Figure 3.28. The client creates a Socket and requests
a connection with the server at IP address 127.0.0.1 on port 6013. Once the
connection is made, the client can read from the socket using normal stream
I/O statements. After it has received the date from the server, the client closes
the socket and exits. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address known as the
loopback. When a computer refers to IP address 127.0.0.1, it is referring to itself.
This mechanism allows a client and server on the same host to communicate
using the TCP/IP protocol. The IP address 127.0.0.1 could be replaced with the
IP address of another host running the date server. In addition to an IP address,
an actual host name, such as www.westminstercollege.edu, can be used as
well.

Communication using sockets—although common and efficient—is con-
sidered a low-level form of communication between distributed processes.
One reason is that sockets allow only an unstructured stream of bytes to be
exchanged between the communicating threads. It is the responsibility of the
client or server application to impose a structure on the data. In the next sub-
section, we look a higher-level method of communication: remote procedure
calls (RPCs).
Remote Procedure Calls
One of the most common forms of remote service is the RPC paradigm, which
was designed as a way to abstract the procedure-call mechanism for use
between systems with network connections. It is similar in many respects to the
IPC mechanism described in Section 3.4, and it is usually built on top of such a
system. Here, however, because we are dealing with an environment in which
the processes are executing on separate systems, we must use a message-based
communication scheme to provide remote service.
Processes
In contrast to IPC messages, the messages exchanged in RPC communi-
cation are well structured and are thus no longer just packets of data. Each
message is addressed to an RPC daemon listening to a port on the remote sys-
tem, and each contains an identifier specifying the function to execute and the
parameters to pass to that function. The function is then executed as requested,
and any output is sent back to the requester in a separate message.
A port in this context is simply a number included at the start of a message
packet. Whereas a system normally has one network address, it can have
many ports within that address to differentiate the many network services it
supports. If a remote process needs a service, it addresses a message to the
proper port. For instance, if a system wished to allow other systems to be
able to list its current users, it would have a daemon supporting such an RPC
attached to a port—say, port 3027. Any remote system could obtain the needed
information (that is, the list of current users) by sending an RPC message to port
3027 on the server. The data would be received in a reply message.
The semantics of RPCs allows a client to invoke a procedure on a remote
host as it would invoke a procedure locally. The RPC system hides the details
that allow communication to take place by providing a stub on the client side.
Typically, a separate stub exists for each separate remote procedure. When
the client invokes a remote procedure, the RPC system calls the appropriate
stub, passing it the parameters provided to the remote procedure. This stub
locates the port on the server and marshals the parameters. The stub then
transmits a message to the server using message passing. A similar stub on the
server side receives this message and invokes the procedure on the server. If
necessary, return values are passed back to the client using the same technique.
On Windows systems, stub code is compiled from a specification written in the
Microsoft Interface Definitio
Language (MIDL), which is used for defining
the interfaces between client and server programs.
Parameter marshaling addresses the issue concerning differences in data
representation on the client and server machines. Consider the representa-
tion of 32-bit integers. Some systems (known as big-endian) store the most
significant byte first, while other systems (known as little-endian) store the
least significant byte first. Neither order is “better” per se; rather, the choice is
arbitrary within a computer architecture. To resolve differences like this, many
RPC systems define a machine-independent representation of data. One such
representation is known as external data representation (XDR). On the client
side, parameter marshaling involves converting the machine-dependent data
into XDR before they are sent to the server. On the server side, the XDR data are
unmarshaled and converted to the machine-dependent representation for the
server.
Another important issue involves the semantics of a call. Whereas local
procedure calls fail only under extreme circumstances, RPCs can fail, or be
duplicated and executed more than once, as a result of common network
errors. One way to address this problem is for the operating system to ensure
that messages are acted on exactly once, rather than at most once. Most local
procedure calls have the “exactly once” functionality, but it is more difficult to
implement.
First, consider “at most once.” This semantic can be implemented by attach-
ing a timestamp to each message. The server must keep a history of all the
timestamps of messages it has already processed or a history large enough


## 3.8 Communication in Client–Server Systems
> id: ch03-3-8 | src: book 3.8 | kind: concept

to ensure that repeated messages are detected. Incoming messages that have
a timestamp already in the history are ignored. The client can then send a
message one or more times and be assured that it only executes once.
For “exactly once,” we need to remove the risk that the server will never
receive the request. To accomplish this, the server must implement the “at most
once” protocol described above but must also acknowledge to the client that
the RPC call was received and executed. These ACK messages are common
throughout networking. The client must resend each RPC call periodically until
it receives the ACK for that call.
Yet another important issue concerns the communication between a server
and a client. With standard procedure calls, some form of binding takes place
during link, load, or execution time (Chapter 9) so that a procedure call’s name
is replaced by the memory address of the procedure call. The RPC scheme
requires a similar binding of the client and the server port, but how does a client
know the port numbers on the server? Neither system has full information
about the other, because they do not share memory.
Two approaches are common. First, the binding information may be prede-
termined, in the form of fixed port addresses. At compile time, an RPC call has
a fixed port number associated with it. Once a program is compiled, the server
cannot change the port number of the requested service. Second, binding can be
done dynamically by a rendezvous mechanism. Typically, an operating system
provides a rendezvous (also called a matchmaker) daemon on a fixed RPC port.
Aclient then sends a message containing the name of the RPC to the rendezvous
daemon requesting the port address of the RPC it needs to execute. The port
number is returned, and the RPC calls can be sent to that port until the process
terminates (or the server crashes). This method requires the extra overhead of
the initial request but is more flexible than the first approach. Figure 3.29 shows
a sample interaction.
The RPC scheme is useful in implementing a distributed file system (Chap-
ter 19). Such a system can be implemented as a set of RPC daemons and clients.
The messages are addressed to the distributed file system port on a server on
which a file operation is to take place. The message contains the disk operation
to be performed. The disk operation might be read(), write(), rename(),
delete(), or status(), corresponding to the usual file-related system calls.
The return message contains any data resulting from that call, which is exe-
cuted by the DFS daemon on behalf of the client. For instance, a message might
contain a request to transfer a whole file to a client or be limited to a simple
block request. In the latter case, several requests may be needed if a whole file
is to be transferred.
Android RPC
Although RPCs are typically associated with client-server computing in a dis-
tributed system, they can also be used as a form of IPC between processes
running on the same system. The Android operating system has a rich set of
IPC mechanisms contained in its binder framework, including RPCs that allow
one process to request services from another process.
Android defines an application component as a basic building block that
provides utility to an Android application, and an app may combine multiple
application components to provide functionality to an app. One such applica-

tion component is a service, which has no user interface but instead runs in
the background while executing long-running operations or performing work
for remote processes. Examples of services include playing music in the back-
ground and retrieving data over a network connection on behalf of another
process, thereby preventing the other process from blocking as the data are
being downloaded. When a client app invokes the bindService() method
of a service, that service is “bound” and available to provide client-server
communication using either message passing or RPCs.
A bound service must extend the Android class Service and must imple-
ment the method onBind(), which is invoked when a client calls bindSer-
vice(). In the case of message passing, the onBind() method returns a Mes-
senger service, which is used for sending messages from the client to the
service. The Messenger service is only one-way; if the service must send a reply
back to the client, the client must also provide a Messenger service, which is
contained in the replyTo field of the Message object sent to the service. The
service can then send messages back to the client.
To provide RPCs, the onBind() method must return an interface repre-
senting the methods in the remote object that clients use to interact with the

service. This interface is written in regular Java syntax and uses the Android
Interface Definition Language—AIDL—to create stub files, which serve as the
client interface to remote services.
Here, we briefly outline the process required to provide a generic remote
service named remoteMethod() using AIDL and the binder service. The inter-
face for the remote service appears as follows:
/* RemoteService.aidl */
interface RemoteService
{
boolean remoteMethod(int x, double y);
{
This file is written as RemoteService.aidl. The Android development kit
will use it to generate a .java interface from the .aidl file, as well as a stub
that serves as the RPC interface for this service. The server must implement the
interface generated by the .aidl file, and the implementation of this interface
will be called when the client invokes remoteMethod().
When a client calls bindService(), the onBind() method is invoked on
the server, and it returns the stub for the RemoteService object to the client.
The client can then invoke the remote method as follows:
RemoteService service;
. . .
service.remoteMethod(3, 0.14);
Internally, the Android binder framework handles parameter marshaling,
transferring marshaled parameters between processes, and invoking the nec-
essary implementation of the service, as well as sending any return values back
to the client process.


## 3.9 Summary

• Aprocess is a program in execution, and the status of the current activity of
a process is represented by the program counter, as well as other registers.
• The layout of a process in memory is represented by four different sections:
(1) text, (2) data, (3) heap, and (4) stack.
• As a process executes, it changes state. There are four general states of a
process: (1) ready, (2) running, (3) waiting, and (4) terminated.
• A process control block (PCB) is the kernel data structure that represents a
process in an operating system.
• The role of the process scheduler is to select an available process to run on
a CPU.
• An operating system performs a context switch when it switches from
running one process to running another.
Processes
• The fork() and CreateProcess() system calls are used to create pro-
cesses on UNIX and Windows systems, respectively.
• When shared memory is used for communication between processes, two
(or more) processes share the same region of memory. POSIX provides an
API for shared memory.
• Two processes may communicate by exchanging messages with one
another using message passing. The Mach operating system uses message
passing as its primary form of interprocess communication. Windows
provides a form of message passing as well.
• A pipe provides a conduit for two processes to communicate. There are
two forms of pipes, ordinary and named. Ordinary pipes are designed for
communication between processes that have a parent–child relationship.
Named pipes are more general and allow several processes to communi-
cate.
• UNIX systems provide ordinary pipes through the pipe() system call.
Ordinary pipes have a read end and a write end. A parent process can, for
example, send data to the pipe using its write end, and the child process
can read it from its read end. Named pipes in UNIX are termed FIFOs.
• Windows systems also provide two forms of pipes—anonymous and
named pipes. Anonymous pipes are similar to UNIX ordinary pipes. They
are unidirectional and employ parent–child relationships between the
communicating processes. Named pipes offer a richer form of interprocess
communication than the UNIX counterpart, FIFOs.
• Two common forms of client–server communication are sockets and
remote procedure calls (RPCs). Sockets allow two processes on different
machines to communicate over a network. RPCs abstract the concept of
function (procedure) calls in such a way that a function can be invoked on
another process that may reside on a separate computer.
• The Android operating system uses RPCs as a form of interprocess com-
munication using its binder framework.

Programming Problems
Programming Problems
Using either a UNIX or a Linux system, write a C program that forks
a child process that ultimately becomes a zombie process. This zombie
process must remain in the system for at least 10 seconds. Process states
can be obtained from the command
ps -l
The process states are shown below the S column; processes with a state
of Z are zombies. The process identifier (pid) of the child process is listed
in the PID column, and that of the parent is listed in the PPID column.
Perhaps the easiest way to determine that the child process is indeed
a zombie is to run the program that you have written in the background
(using the &) and then run the command ps -l to determine whether
the child is a zombie process. Because you do not want too many zombie
processes existing in the system, you will need to remove the one that
you have created. The easiest way to do that is to terminate the parent
process using the kill command. For example, if the pid of the parent
is 4884, you would enter
kill -9 4884
Write a C program called time.c that determines the amount of time
necessary to run a command from the command line. This program will
be run as "./time <command>" and will report the amount of elapsed
time to run the specified command. This will involve using fork() and
exec() functions, as well as the gettimeofday() function to deter-
mine the elapsed time. It will also require the use of two different IPC
mechanisms.
The general strategy is to fork a child process that will execute the
specified command. However, before the child executes the command,
it will record a timestamp of the current time (which we term “starting
time”). The parent process will wait for the child process to terminate.
Once the child terminates, the parent will record the current timestamp
for the ending time. The difference between the starting and ending
times represents the elapsed time to execute the command. The example
output below reports the amount of time to run the command ls :
./time ls
time.c
time
Elapsed time: 0.25422
As the parent and child are separate processes, they will need to
arrange how the starting time will be shared between them. You will
write two versions of this program, each representing a different method
of IPC.
P-8
Processes
The first version will have the child process write the starting time to
a region of shared memory before it calls exec(). After the child process
terminates, the parent will read the starting time from shared memory.
Refer to Section 3.7.1 for details using POSIX shared memory. In that
section, there are separate programs for the producer and consumer. As
the solution to this problem requires only a single program, the region
of shared memory can be established before the child process is forked,
allowing both the parent and child processes access to the region of
shared memory.
The second version will use a pipe. The child will write the starting
time to the pipe, and the parent will read from it following the termina-
tion of the child process.
You will use the gettimeofday() function to record the current
timestamp. This function is passed a pointer to a struct timeval
object, which contains two members: tv sec and t usec. These repre-
sent the number of elapsed seconds and microseconds since January 1,
1970 (known as the UNIX EPOCH). The following code sample illustrates
how this function can be used:
struct timeval current;
gettimeofday(&current,NULL);
// current.tv sec represents seconds
// current.tv usec represents microseconds
For IPC between the child and parent processes, the contents of the
shared memory pointer can be assigned the struct timeval repre-
senting the starting time. When pipes are used, a pointer to a struct
timeval can be written to—and read from—the pipe.
An operating system’s pid manager is responsible for managing process
identifiers. When a process is first created, it is assigned a unique pid
by the pid manager. The pid is returned to the pid manager when the
process completes execution, and the manager may later reassign this
pid. Process identifiers are discussed more fully in Section 3.3.1. What
is most important here is to recognize that process identifiers must be
unique; no two active processes can have the same pid.
Use the following constants to identify the range of possible pid
values:
#define MIN PID 300
#define MAX PID 5000
You may use any data structure of your choice to represent the avail-
ability of process identifiers. One strategy is to adopt what Linux has
done and use a bitmap in which a value of 0 at position i indicates that

Implement the following API for obtaining and releasing a pid:
• int allocate map(void)—Creates and initializes a data struc-
ture for representing pids; returns −1 if unsuccessful, 1 if successful
• int allocate pid(void)—Allocates and returns a pid; returns
−1 if unable to allocate a pid (all pids are in use)
• void release pid(int pid)—Releases a pid
This programming problem will be modified later on in Chapter 4 and
in Chapter 6.
The Collatz conjecture concerns what happens when we take any posi-
tive integer n and apply the following algorithm:
n =
{
n∕2,
if n is even
3 × n + 1,
if n is odd
The conjecture states that when this algorithm is continually applied,
all positive integers will eventually reach 1. For example, if n = 35, the
sequence is
35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates this
sequence in the child process. The starting number will be provided
from the command line. For example, if 8 is passed as a parameter on
the command line, the child process will output 8, 4, 2, 1. Because the
parent and child processes have their own copies of the data, it will be
necessary for the child to output the sequence. Have the parent invoke
the wait() call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting
the program. Perform necessary error checking to ensure that a positive
integer is passed on the command line.
In Exercise 3.21, the child process must output the sequence of num-
bers generated from the algorithm specified by the Collatz conjecture
because the parent and child have their own copies of the data. Another
approach to designing this program is to establish a shared-memory
object between the parent and child processes. This technique allows
the child to write the contents of the sequence to the shared-memory
object. The parent can then output the sequence when the child com-
pletes. Because the memory is shared, any changes the child makes will
be reflected in the parent process as well.
This program will be structured using POSIX shared memory as
described in Section 3.7.1. The parent process will progress through the
following steps:
a.
Establish the shared-memory object (shm open(), ftruncate(),
and mmap()).
P-10
Processes
b.
Create the child process and wait for it to terminate.
c.
Output the contents of shared memory.
d.
Remove the shared-memory object.
One area of concern with cooperating processes involves synchro-
nization issues. In this exercise, the parent and child processes must be
coordinated so that the parent does not output the sequence until the
child finishes execution. These two processes will be synchronized using
the wait() system call: the parent process will invoke wait(), which
will suspend it until the child process exits.
Section 3.8.1 describes certain port numbers as being well known—that
is, they provide standard services. Port 17 is known as the quote-of-the-
day service. When a client connects to port 17 on a server, the server
responds with a quote for that day.
Modify the date server shown in Figure 3.27 so that it delivers a quote
of the day rather than the current date. The quotes should be printable
ASCII characters and should contain fewer than 512 characters, although
multiple lines are allowed. Since these well-known ports are reserved
and therefore unavailable, have your server listen to port 6017. The date
client shown in Figure 3.28 can be used to read the quotes returned by
your server.
Ahaiku is a three-line poem in which the first line contains five syllables,
the second line contains seven syllables, and the third line contains five
syllables. Write a haiku server that listens to port 5575. When a client
connects to this port, the server responds with a haiku. The date client
shown in Figure 3.28 can be used to read the quotes returned by your
haiku server.
An echo server echoes back whatever it receives from a client. For exam-
ple, if a client sends the server the string Hello there!, the server will
respond with Hello there!
Write an echo server using the Java networking API described in
Section 3.8.1. This server will wait for a client connection using the
accept() method. When a client connection is received, the server will
loop, performing the following steps:
• Read data from the socket into a buffer.
• Write the contents of the buffer back to the client.
The server will break out of the loop only when it has determined that
the client has closed the connection.
The date server of Figure 3.27 uses the java.io.BufferedReader
class. BufferedReader extends the java.io.Reader class, which is
used for reading character streams. However, the echo server cannot
guarantee that it will read characters from clients; it may receive binary
data as well. The class java.io.InputStream deals with data at the byte
level rather than the character level. Thus, your echo server must use an
object that extends java.io.InputStream. The read() method in the

java.io.InputStream class returns −1 when the client has closed its
end of the socket connection.
Design a program using ordinary pipes in which one process sends a
string message to a second process, and the second process reverses
the case of each character in the message and sends it back to the first
process. For example, if the first process sends the message Hi There,
the second process will return hI tHERE. This will require using two
pipes, one for sending the original message from the first to the second
process and the other for sending the modified message from the second
to the first process. You can write this program using either UNIX or
Windows pipes.
Design a file-copying program named filecopy.c using ordinary
pipes. This program will be passed two parameters: the name of the file
to be copied and the name of the destination file. The program will then
create an ordinary pipe and write the contents of the file to be copied to
the pipe. The child process will read this file from the pipe and write it
to the destination file. For example, if we invoke the program as follows:
./filecopy input.txt copy.txt
the file input.txt will be written to the pipe. The child process will read
the contents of this file and write it to the destination file copy.txt. You
may write this program using either UNIX or Windows pipes.
Programming Projects
Project 1—UNIX Shell
This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface
that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate
process. Your implementation will support input and output redirection, as
well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands. Completing this
project will involve using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and
pipe() system calls and can be completed on any Linux, UNIX, or macOS
system.
I. Overview
A shell interface gives the user a prompt, after which the next command
is entered. The example below illustrates the prompt osh> and the user’s
next command: cat prog.c. (This command displays the file prog.c on the
terminal using the UNIX cat command.)
osh>cat prog.c
P-12
Processes
One technique for implementing a shell interface is to have the parent process
first read what the user enters on the command line (in this case, cat prog.c)
and then create a separate child process that performs the command. Unless
otherwise specified, the parent process waits for the child to exit before contin-
uing. This is similar in functionality to the new process creation illustrated in
Figure 3.9. However, UNIX shells typically also allow the child process to run
in the background, or concurrently. To accomplish this, we add an ampersand
(&) at the end of the command. Thus, if we rewrite the above command as
osh>cat prog.c &
the parent and child processes will run concurrently.
The separate child process is created using the fork() system call, and the
user’s command is executed using one of the system calls in the exec() family
(as described in Section 3.3.1).
A C program that provides the general operations of a command-line shell
is supplied in Figure 3.36. The main() function presents the prompt osh->
and outlines the steps to be taken after input from the user has been read. The
main() function continually loops as long as should run equals 1; when the
user enters exit at the prompt, your program will set should run to 0 and
terminate.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#define MAX LINE 80 /* The maximum length command */
int main(void)
{
char *args[MAX LINE/2 + 1]; /* command line arguments */
int should run = 1; /* flag to determine when to exit program */
while (should run) {
printf("osh>");
fflush(stdout);
/**
* After reading user input, the steps are:
* (1) fork a child process using fork()
* (2) the child process will invoke execvp()
* (3) parent will invoke wait() unless command included &

Programming Projects
This project is organized into several parts:
1. Creating the child process and executing the command in the child
2. Providing a history feature
3. Adding support of input and output redirection
4. Allowing the parent and child processes to communicate via a pipe
II. Executing Command in a Child Process
The first task is to modify the main() function in Figure 3.36 so that a child
process is forked and executes the command specified by the user. This will
require parsing what the user has entered into separate tokens and storing the
tokens in an array of character strings (args in Figure 3.36). For example, if the
user enters the command ps -ael at the osh> prompt, the values stored in the
args array are:
args[0] = "ps"
args[1] = "-ael"
args[2] = NULL
This args array will be passed to the execvp() function, which has the follow-
ing prototype:
execvp(char *command, char *params[])
Here, command represents the command to be performed and params stores the
parameters to this command. For this project, the execvp() function should
be invoked as execvp(args[0], args). Be sure to check whether the user
included & to determine whether or not the parent process is to wait for the
child to exit.
III. Creating a History Feature
The next task is to modify the shell interface program so that it provides a
history feature to allow a user to execute the most recent command by entering
!!. For example, if a user enters the command ls -l, she can then execute that
command again by entering !! at the prompt. Any command executed in this
fashion should be echoed on the user’s screen, and the command should also
be placed in the history buffer as the next command.
Your program should also manage basic error handling. If there is no recent
command in the history, entering !! should result in a message “No commands
in history.”
IV. Redirecting Input and Output
Your shell should then be modified to support the ‘>’ and ‘<’ redirection
P-14
Processes
operators, where ‘>’ redirects the output of a command to a file and ‘<’ redirects
the input to a command from a file. For example, if a user enters
osh>ls > out.txt
the output from the ls command will be redirected to the file out.txt. Simi-
larly, input can be redirected as well. For example, if the user enters
osh>sort < in.txt
the file in.txt will serve as input to the sort command.
Managing the redirection of both input and output will involve using the
dup2() function, which duplicates an existing file descriptor to another file
descriptor. For example, if fd is a file descriptor to the file out.txt, the call
dup2(fd, STDOUT FILENO);
duplicates fd to standard output (the terminal). This means that any writes to
standard output will in fact be sent to the out.txt file.
You can assume that commands will contain either one input or one output
redirection and will not contain both. In other words, you do not have to be
concerned with command sequences such as sort < in.txt > out.txt.
V. Communication via a Pipe
The final modification to your shell is to allow the output of one command to
serve as input to another using a pipe. For example, the following command
sequence
osh>ls -l | less
has the output of the command ls -l serve as the input to the less com-
mand. Both the ls and less commands will run as separate processes and
will communicate using the UNIX pipe() function described in Section 3.7.4.
Perhaps the easiest way to create these separate processes is to have the parent
process create the child process (which will execute ls -l). This child will also
create another child process (which will execute less) and will establish a pipe
between itself and the child process it creates. Implementing pipe functionality
will also require using the dup2() function as described in the previous section.
Finally, although several commands can be chained together using multiple
pipes, you can assume that commands will contain only one pipe character
and will not be combined with any redirection operators.
Project 2 —Linux Kernel Module for Task Information
In this project, you will write a Linux kernel module that uses the /proc file
system for displaying a task’s information based on its process identifier value
pid. Before beginning this project, be sure you have completed the Linux kernel
module programming project in Chapter 2, which involves creating an entry
in the /proc file system. This project will involve writing a process identifier to
P-15
Programming Projects
the file /proc/pid. Once a pid has been written to the /proc file, subsequent
reads from /proc/pid will report (1) the command the task is running, (2) the
value of the task’s pid, and (3) the current state of the task. An example of how
your kernel module will be accessed once loaded into the system is as follows:
echo "1395" > /proc/pid
cat /proc/pid
command = [bash] pid = [1395] state = [1]
The echo command writes the characters "1395" to the /proc/pid file. Your
kernel module will read this value and store its integer equivalent as it rep-
resents a process identifier. The cat command reads from /proc/pid, where
your kernel module will retrieve the three fields from the task struct associ-
ated with the task whose pid value is 1395.
ssize t proc write(struct file *file, char
user *usr buf,
size t count, loff t *pos)
{
int rv = 0;
char *k mem;
/* allocate kernel memory */
k mem = kmalloc(count, GFP KERNEL);
/* copies user space usr buf to kernel memory */
copy from user(k mem, usr buf, count);
printk(KERN INFO "%s∖n", k mem);
/* return kernel memory */
kfree(k mem);
return count;
}
Figure 3.37
The proc write() function.
I. Writing to the /proc File System
In the kernel module project in Chapter 2, you learned how to read from the
/proc file system. We now cover how to write to /proc. Setting the field
.write in struct file operations to
.write = proc write
causes the proc write() function of Figure 3.37 to be called when a write
operation is made to /proc/pid
P-16
Processes
The kmalloc() function is the kernel equivalent of the user-level mal-
loc() function for allocating memory, except that kernel memory is being
allocated. The GFP KERNEL flag indicates routine kernel memory allocation.
The copy from user() function copies the contents of usr buf (which con-
tains what has been written to /proc/pid) to the recently allocated kernel
memory. Your kernel module will have to obtain the integer equivalent of this
value using the kernel function kstrtol(), which has the signature
int kstrtol(const char *str, unsigned int base, long *res)
This stores the character equivalent of str, which is expressed as a base into
res.
Finally, note that we return memory that was previously allocated with
kmalloc() back to the kernel with the call to kfree(). Careful memory man-
agement—which includes releasing memory to prevent memory leaks—is
crucial when developing kernel-level code.
II. Reading from the /proc File System
Once the process identifier has been stored, any reads from /proc/pid
will return the name of the command, its process identifier, and its state.
As illustrated in Section 3.1, the PCB in Linux is represented by the
structure task struct, which is found in the <linux/sched.h> include
file. Given a process identifier, the function pid task() returns the associated
task struct. The signature of this function appears as follows:
struct task struct pid task(struct pid *pid,
enum pid type type)
The kernel function find vpid(int pid) can be used to obtain the struct
pid, and PIDTYPE PID can be used as the pid type.
For a valid pid in the system, pid task will return its task struct. You
can then display the values of the command, pid, and state. (You will probably
have to read through the task struct structure in <linux/sched.h> to obtain
the names of these fields.)
If pid task() is not passed a valid pid, it returns NULL. Be sure to perform
appropriate error checking to check for this condition. If this situation occurs,
the kernel module function associated with reading from /proc/pid should
return 0.
In the source code download, we give the C program pid.c, which pro-
vides some of the basic building blocks for beginning this project.
Project 3—Linux Kernel Module for Listing Tasks
In this project, you will write a kernel module that lists all current tasks in a
Linux system. You will iterate through the tasks both linearly and depth first.
Part I—Iterating over Tasks Linearly
In the Linux kernel, the for each process() macro easily allows iteration
over all current tasks in the system:
P-17
Programming Projects
#include <linux/sched.h>
struct task struct *task;
for each process(task) {
/* on each iteration task points to the next task */
}
The various fields in task struct can then be displayed as the program loops
through the for each process() macro.
Assignment
Design a kernel module that iterates through all tasks in the system using the
for each process() macro. In particular, output the task command, state,
and process id of each task. (You will probably have to read through the
task struct structure in <linux/sched.h> to obtain the names of these
fields.) Write this code in the module entry point so that its contents will appear
in the kernel log buffer, which can be viewed using the dmesg command. To
verify that your code is working correctly, compare the contents of the kernel
log buffer with the output of the following command, which lists all tasks in
the system:
ps -el
The two values should be very similar. Because tasks are dynamic, however, it
is possible that a few tasks may appear in one listing but not the other.
Part II—Iterating over Tasks with a Depth-First Search Tree
The second portion of this project involves iterating over all tasks in the system
using a depth-first search (DFS) tree. (As an example: the DFS iteration of the
processes in Figure 3.7 is 1, 8415, 8416, 9298, 9204, 2808, 3028, 3610, 4005.)
Linux maintains its process tree as a series of lists. Examining the
task struct in <linux/sched.h>, we see two struct list head objects:
children
and
sibling
These objects are pointers to a list of the task’s children, as well as its siblings.
Linux also maintains a reference to the initial task in the system — init task
— which is of type task struct. Using this information as well as macro
operations on lists, we can iterate over the children of init task as follows:
struct task struct *task;
struct list head *list;
P-18
Processes
list for each(list, &init task->children) {
task = list entry(list, struct task struct, sibling);
/* task points to the next child in the list */
}
The list for each() macro is passed two parameters, both of type struct
list head:
• A pointer to the head of the list to be traversed
• A pointer to the head node of the list to be traversed
At each iteration of list for each(), the first parameter is set to the list
structure of the next child. We then use this value to obtain each structure in
the list using the list entry() macro.
Assignment
Beginning from init task task, design a kernel module that iterates over all
tasks in the system using a DFS tree. Just as in the first part of this project, output
the name, state, and pid of each task. Perform this iteration in the kernel entry
module so that its output appears in the kernel log buffer.
If you output all tasks in the system, you may see many more tasks than
appear with the ps -ael command. This is because some threads appear as
children but do not show up as ordinary processes. Therefore, to check the
output of the DFS tree, use the command
ps -eLf
This command lists all tasks—including threads—in the system. To verify that
you have indeed performed an appropriate DFS iteration, you will have to
examine the relationships among the various tasks output by the ps command.
Project 4—Kernel Data Structures
In Section 1.9, we covered various data structures that are common in oper-
ating systems. The Linux kernel provides several of these structures. Here,
we explore using the circular, doubly linked list that is available to kernel
developers. Much of what we discuss is available in the Linux source code—
in this instance, the include file <linux/list.h>—and we recommend that
you examine this file as you proceed through the following steps.
Initially, you must define a struct containing the elements that are to be
inserted in the linked list. The following C struct defines a color as a mixture
of red, blue, and green:
struct color {
int red;
int blue;
int green;
P-19
Programming Projects
struct list head list;
};
Notice the member struct list head list. The list head structure is
defined in the include file <linux/types.h>, and its intention is to embed the
linked list within the nodes that comprise the list. This list head structure is
quite simple—it merely holds two members, next and prev, that point to the
next and previous entries in the list. By embedding the linked list within the
structure, Linux makes it possible to manage the data structure with a series of
macro functions.
I. Inserting Elements into the Linked List
We can declare a list head object, which we use as a reference to the head of
the list by using the LIST HEAD() macro:
static LIST HEAD(color list);
This macro defines and initializes the variable color list, which is of type
struct list head.
We create and initialize instances of struct color as follows:
struct color *violet;
violet = kmalloc(sizeof(*violet), GFP KERNEL);
violet->red = 138;
violet->blue = 43;
violet->green = 226;
INIT LIST HEAD(&violet->list);
The kmalloc() function is the kernel equivalent of the user-level malloc()
function for allocating memory, except that kernel memory is being allocated.
The GFP KERNEL flag indicates routine kernel memory allocation. The macro
INIT LIST HEAD() initializes the list member in struct color. We can then
add this instance to the end of the linked list using the list add tail() macro:
list add tail(&violet->list, &color list);
II. Traversing the Linked List
Traversing the list involves using the list for each entry() macro, which
accepts three parameters:
• A pointer to the structure being iterated over
• A pointer to the head of the list being iterated over
• The name of the variable containing the list head structure
The following code illustrates this macro:
P-20
Processes
struct color *ptr;
list for each entry(ptr, &color list, list) {
/* on each iteration ptr points */
/* to the next struct color */
}
III. Removing Elements from the Linked List
Removing elements from the list involves using the list del() macro, which
is passed a pointer to struct list head:
list del(struct list head *element);
This removes element from the list while maintaining the structure of the
remainder of the list.
Perhaps the simplest approach for removing all elements from a
linked list is to remove each element as you traverse the list. The macro
list for each entry safe() behaves much like list for each entry()
except that it is passed an additional argument that maintains the value of the
next pointer of the item being deleted. (This is necessary for preserving the
structure of the list.) The following code example illustrates this macro:
struct color *ptr, *next;
list for each entry safe(ptr,next,&color list,list) {
/* on each iteration ptr points */
/* to the next struct color */
list del(&ptr->list);
kfree(ptr);
}
Notice that after deleting each element, we return memory that was previously
allocated with kmalloc() back to the kernel with the call to kfree().
Part I—Assignment
In the module entry point, create a linked list containing four struct color
elements. Traverse the linked list and output its contents to the kernel log
buffer. Invoke the dmesg command to ensure that the list is properly con-
structed once the kernel module has been loaded.
In the module exit point, delete the elements from the linked list and return
the free memory back to the kernel. Again, invoke the dmesg command to check
that the list has been removed once the kernel module has been unloaded.
Part II—Parameter Passing
This portion of the project will involve passing a parameter to a kernel module.
The module will use this parameter as an initial value and generate the Collatz
sequence as described in Exercise 3.21.
P-21
Programming Projects
Passing a Parameter to a Kernel Module
Parameters may be passed to kernel modules when they are loaded. For exam-
ple, if the name of the kernel module is collatz, we can pass the initial value
of 15 to the kernel parameter start as follows:
sudo insmod collatz.ko start=15
Within the kernel module, we declare start as a parameter using the following
code:
#include<linux/moduleparam.h>
static int start = 25;
module param(start, int, 0);
The module param() macro is used to establish variables as parameters to
kernel modules. module param() is provided three arguments: (1) the name
of the parameter, (2) its type, and (3) file permissions. Since we are not using a
file system for accessing the parameter, we are not concerned with permissions
and use a default value of 0. Note that the name of the parameter used with
the insmod command must match the name of the associated kernel parameter.
Finally, if we do not provide a value to the module parameter during loading
with insmod, the default value (which in this case is 25) is used.
Part II—Assignment
Design a kernel module named collatz that is passed an initial value as a
module parameter. Your module will then generate and store the sequence in
a kernel linked list when the module is loaded. Once the sequence has been
stored, your module will traverse the list and output its contents to the kernel
log buffer. Use the dmesg command to ensure that the sequence is properly
generated once the module has been loaded.
In the module exit point, delete the contents of the list and return the free
memory back to the kernel. Again, use dmesg to check that the list has been
removed once the kernel module has been unloaded.
