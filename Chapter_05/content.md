CPU
Scheduling
CPU scheduling is the basis of multiprogrammed operating systems. By switch-
ing the CPU among processes, the operating system can make the computer
more productive. In this chapter, we introduce basic CPU-scheduling concepts
and present several CPU-scheduling algorithms, including real-time systems.
We also consider the problem of selecting an algorithm for a particular system.
In Chapter 4, we introduced threads to the process model. On modern oper-
ating systems it is kernel-level threads—not processes—that are in fact being
scheduled by the operating system. However, the terms "process scheduling"
and "thread scheduling" are often used interchangeably. In this chapter, we use
process scheduling when discussing general scheduling concepts and thread
scheduling to refer to thread-specific ideas.
Similarly, in Chapter 1 we describe how a core is the basic computational
unit of a CPU, and that a process executes on a CPU’s core. However, in many
instances in this chapter, when we use the general terminology of scheduling
a process to "run on a CPU", we are implying that the process is running on a
CPU’s core.

In a system with a single CPU core, only one process can run at a time. Others
must wait until the CPU’s core is free and can be rescheduled. The objective of
multiprogramming is to have some process running at all times, to maximize
CPU utilization. The idea is relatively simple. Aprocess is executed until it must
wait, typically for the completion of some I/O request. In a simple computer
system, the CPU then just sits idle. All this waiting time is wasted; no useful
work is accomplished. With multiprogramming, we try to use this time produc-
tively. Several processes are kept in memory at one time. When one process has
to wait, the operating system takes the CPU away from that process and gives
the CPU to another process. This pattern continues. Every time one process has
to wait, another process can take over use of the CPU. On a multicore system,
this concept of keeping the CPU busy is extended to all processing cores on the
system.
Scheduling of this kind is a fundamental operating-system function.
Almost all computer resources are scheduled before use. The CPU is, of course,
one of the primary computer resources. Thus, its scheduling is central to
operating-system design.

**CPU Scheduler**

- The CPU scheduler selects from among the processes in ready queue, and allocates a CPU core to one of them
  - Queue may be ordered in various ways
- CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process:
  - 1.	Switches from running to waiting state
  - 2.	Switches from running to ready state
  - 3.	Switches from waiting to ready
  - Terminates
- For situations 1 and 4, there is no choice in terms of scheduling. A new process (if one exists in the ready queue) must be selected for execution.
- For situations 2 and 3, however, there is  a choice.


**Preemptive and Nonpreemptive Scheduling**

- When scheduling takes place only under circumstances 1 and 4, the scheduling scheme is nonpreemptive.
- Otherwise, it is preemptive.
- Under Nonpreemptive scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps the CPU until it releases it either by terminating or by switching to the waiting state.
- Virtually all modern operating systems including Windows, MacOS, Linux, and UNIX use preemptive scheduling algorithms.


**Preemptive Scheduling and Race Conditions**

- Preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions when data are shared among several processes.
- Consider the case of two processes that share data. While one process is updating the data, it is preempted so that the second process can run. The second process then tries to read the data, which are in an inconsistent state.
- This issue will be explored in detail in Chapter 6.


**Dispatcher**

- Dispatcher module gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the CPU scheduler; this involves:
  - Switching context
  - Switching to user mode
  - Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program
- Dispatch latency – time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running

- Implementation
- Even simulations have limited accuracy
- Just implement new scheduler and test in real systems
  - High cost, high risk
  - Environments vary
- Most flexible schedulers can be modified per-site or per-system
- Or APIs to modify priorities
- But again environments vary

## 5.1 Basic Concepts
> id: ch05-5-1 | src: book 5.1 | kind: concept

CPU–I/O Burst Cycle
The success of CPU scheduling depends on an observed property of processes:
process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait. Processes
alternate between these two states. Process execution begins with a CPU burst.
That is followed by an I/O burst, which is followed by another CPU burst, then
another I/O burst, and so on. Eventually, the final CPU burst ends with a system
request to terminate execution (Figure 5.1).
The durations of CPU bursts have been measured extensively. Although
they vary greatly from process to process and from computer to computer,
they tend to have a frequency curve similar to that shown in Figure 5.2. The
curve is generally characterized as exponential or hyperexponential, with a
large number of short CPU bursts and a small number of long CPU bursts.
An I/O-bound program typically has many short CPU bursts. A CPU-bound
program might have a few long CPU bursts. This distribution can be important
when implementing a CPU-scheduling algorithm.
CPU Scheduler
Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the
processes in the ready queue to be executed. The selection process is carried out
by the CPU scheduler, which selects a process from the processes in memory
that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to that process.
Note that the ready queue is not necessarily a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue.
As we shall see when we consider the various scheduling algorithms, a ready
queue can be implemented as a FIFO queue, a priority queue, a tree, or simply
an unordered linked list. Conceptually, however, all the processes in the ready
queue are lined up waiting for a chance to run on the CPU. The records in the
queues are generally process control blocks (PCBs) of the processes.

Histogram of CPU-burst durations.
CPU Scheduling
Preemptive and Nonpreemptive Scheduling
CPU-scheduling decisions may take place under the following four circum-
stances:
1. When a process switches from the running state to the waiting state (for
example, as the result of an I/O request or an invocation of wait() for the
termination of a child process)
2. When a process switches from the running state to the ready state (for
example, when an interrupt occurs)
3. When a process switches from the waiting state to the ready state (for
example, at completion of I/O)
4. When a process terminates
For situations 1 and 4, there is no choice in terms of scheduling. A new process
(if one exists in the ready queue) must be selected for execution. There is a
choice, however, for situations 2 and 3.
When scheduling takes place only under circumstances 1 and 4, we say that
the scheduling scheme is nonpreemptive or cooperative. Otherwise, it is pre-
emptive. Under nonpreemptive scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated
to a process, the process keeps the CPU until it releases it either by terminating
or by switching to the waiting state. Virtually all modern operating systems
including Windows, macOS, Linux, and UNIX use preemptive scheduling algo-
rithms.
Unfortunately, preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions when
data are shared among several processes. Consider the case of two processes
that share data. While one process is updating the data, it is preempted so
that the second process can run. The second process then tries to read the
data, which are in an inconsistent state. This issue will be explored in detail
in Chapter 6.
Preemption also affects the design of the operating-system kernel. During
the processing of a system call, the kernel may be busy with an activity on
behalf of a process. Such activities may involve changing important kernel
data (for instance, I/O queues). What happens if the process is preempted
in the middle of these changes and the kernel (or the device driver) needs
to read or modify the same structure? Chaos ensues. As will be discussed in
Section 6.2, operating-system kernels can be designed as either nonpreemptive
or preemptive. A nonpreemptive kernel will wait for a system call to complete
or for a process to block while waiting for I/O to complete to take place before
doing a context switch. This scheme ensures that the kernel structure is simple,
since the kernel will not preempt a process while the kernel data structures are
in an inconsistent state. Unfortunately, this kernel-execution model is a poor
one for supporting real-time computing, where tasks must complete execution
within a given time frame. In Section 5.6, we explore scheduling demands of
real-time systems. A preemptive kernel requires mechanisms such as mutex
locks to prevent race conditions when accessing shared kernel data structures.
Most modern operating systems are now fully preemptive when running in
kernel mode.

Figure 5.3
The role of the dispatcher.
Because interrupts can, by definition, occur at any time, and because they
cannot always be ignored by the kernel, the sections of code affected by inter-
rupts must be guarded from simultaneous use. The operating system needs to
accept interrupts at almost all times. Otherwise, input might be lost or output
overwritten. So that these sections of code are not accessed concurrently by
several processes, they disable interrupts at entry and reenable interrupts at
exit. It is important to note that sections of code that disable interrupts do not
occur very often and typically contain few instructions.
Dispatcher
Another component involved in the CPU-scheduling function is the dispatcher.
The dispatcher is the module that gives control of the CPU’s core to the process
selected by the CPU scheduler. This function involves the following:
• Switching context from one process to another
• Switching to user mode
• Jumping to the proper location in the user program to resume that program
The dispatcher should be as fast as possible, since it is invoked during every
context switch. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start
another running is known as the dispatch latency and is illustrated in Figure
5.3.
An interesting question to consider is, how often do context switches
occur? On a system-wide level, the number of context switches can be obtained
by using the vmstat command that is available on Linux systems. Below is the
output (which has been trimmed) from the command
vmstat 1 3
CPU Scheduling
This command provides 3 lines of output over a 1-second delay:
------cpu-----
The first line gives the average number of context switches over 1 second
since the system booted, and the next two lines give the number of context
switches over two 1-second intervals. Since this machine booted, it has aver-
aged 24 context switches per second. And in the past second, 225 context
switches were made, with 339 context switches in the second prior to that.
We can also use the /proc file system to determine the number of
context switches for a given process. For example, the contents of the file
/proc/2166/status will list various statistics for the process with pid =
2166. The command
cat /proc/2166/status
provides the following trimmed output:
voluntary ctxt switches
nonvoluntary ctxt switches
This output shows the number of context switches over the lifetime of the
process. Notice the distinction between voluntary and nonvoluntary context
switches. A voluntary context switch occurs when a process has given up
control of the CPU because it requires a resource that is currently unavailable
(such as blocking for I/O.) Anonvoluntary context switch occurs when the CPU
has been taken away from a process, such as when its time slice has expired or
it has been preempted by a higher-priority process.


## 5.2 Scheduling Criteria
> id: ch05-5-2 | src: book 5.2; slides 10-32 | kind: concept

Different CPU-scheduling algorithms have different properties, and the choice
of a particular algorithm may favor one class of processes over another. In
choosing which algorithm to use in a particular situation, we must consider
the properties of the various algorithms.
Many criteria have been suggested for comparing CPU-scheduling algo-
rithms. Which characteristics are used for comparison can make a substantial
difference in which algorithm is judged to be best. The criteria include the
following:
• CPU utilization. We want to keep the CPU as busy as possible. Concep-
tually, CPU utilization can range from 0 to 100 percent. In a real system, it
should range from 40 percent (for a lightly loaded system) to 90 percent
(for a heavily loaded system). (CPU utilization can be obtained by using
the top command on Linux, macOS, and UNIX systems.)
• Throughput. If the CPU is busy executing processes, then work is being
done. One measure of work is the number of processes that are completed


- CPU utilization – keep the CPU as busy as possible
- Throughput – # of processes that complete their execution per time unit
- Turnaround time – amount of time to execute a particular process
- Waiting time – amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue
- Response time – amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is produced.


**Scheduling Algorithm Optimization Criteria**

- Max CPU utilization
- Max throughput
- Min turnaround time
- Min waiting time
- Min response time


**First- Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling**

- Process	Burst Time
- P1	24
- P2 	3
- P3	 3
- Suppose that the processes arrive in the order: P1 , P2 , P3  The Gantt Chart for the schedule is:
- Waiting time for P1  = 0; P2  = 24; P3 = 27
- Average waiting time:  (0 + 24 + 27)/3 = 17

**FCFS Scheduling (Cont.)**

- Suppose that the processes arrive in the order:
- P2 , P3 , P1
- The Gantt chart for the schedule is:
- Waiting time for P1 = 6; P2 = 0; P3 = 3
- Average waiting time:   (6 + 0 + 3)/3 = 3
- Much better than previous case
- Convoy effect - short process behind long process
  - Consider one CPU-bound and many I/O-bound processes

**Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling**

- Associate with each process the length of its next CPU burst
  - Use these lengths to schedule the process with the shortest time
- SJF is optimal – gives minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes
- Preemptive version called shortest-remaining-time-first
- How do we determine the length of the next CPU burst?
  - Could ask the user
  - Estimate


**Example of SJF**

- Process	Burst Time
- P1	6
- P2 	8
- P3	 7
- P4	 3
- SJF scheduling chart
- Average waiting time = (3 + 16 + 9 + 0) / 4 = 7

**Determining Length of Next CPU Burst**

- Can only estimate the length – should be similar to the previous one
  - Then pick process with shortest predicted next CPU burst
- Can be done by using the length of previous CPU bursts, using exponential averaging
- Commonly, α set to ½

**Examples of Exponential Averaging**

-  =0
  - n+1 = n
  - Recent history does not count
-  =1
  - n+1 =  tn
  - Only the actual last CPU burst counts
- If we expand the formula, we get:
    - n+1 =  tn+(1 - ) tn -1 + …
    - +(1 -  )j  tn -j + …
    - +(1 -  )n +1 0
- Since both  and (1 - ) are less than or equal to 1, each successor predecessor  term has less weight than its predecessor


**Shortest Remaining Time First Scheduling**

- Preemptive version of SJN
- Whenever a new process arrives in the ready queue, the decision on which process to schedule next is redone using the SJN algorithm.
- Is SRT more “optimal” than SJN in terms of the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes?


**Example of Shortest-remaining-time-first**

- Now we add the concepts of varying arrival times and preemption to the analysis
- Process      i Arrival TimeT	Burst Time
- P1	0	8
- P2 	1	4
- P3	2	9
- P4	3	5
- Preemptive SJF Gantt Chart
- Average waiting time = [(10-1)+(1-1)+(17-2)+(5-3)]/4 = 26/4 = 6.5

**Round Robin (RR)**

- Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum q), usually 10-100 milliseconds.  After this time has elapsed, the process is preempted and added to the end of the ready queue.
- If there are n processes in the ready queue and the time quantum is q, then each process gets 1/n of the CPU time in chunks of at most q time units at once.  No process waits more than (n-1)q time units.
- Timer interrupts every quantum to schedule next process
- Performance
  - q large  FIFO (FCFS)
  - q small  RR
- Note that q must be large with respect to context switch, otherwise overhead is too high


**Example of RR with Time Quantum = 4**

- Process	Burst Time
- P1	24
- P2	 3
- P3	3
- The Gantt chart is:
- Typically, higher average turnaround than SJF, but better response
- q should be large compared to context switch time
  - q usually 10 milliseconds  to 100 milliseconds,
  - Context switch < 10 microseconds

**Priority Scheduling**

- A priority number (integer) is associated with each process
- The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority (smallest integer  highest priority)
  - Preemptive
  - Nonpreemptive
- SJF is priority scheduling where priority is the inverse of predicted next CPU burst time
- Problem  Starvation – low priority processes may never execute
- Solution  Aging – as time progresses increase the priority of the process


**Example of Priority Scheduling**

- Process	Burst Time	Priority
- P1	10	3
- P2 	1	1
- P3	2	4
- P4	1	5
- P5	5	2
- Priority scheduling Gantt Chart
- Average waiting time = 8.2

**Priority Scheduling w/ Round-Robin**

- Run the process with the highest priority. Processes with the same priority run round-robin
- Example:
- Process	a   Burst Time	Priority
- P1	4	3
- P2 	5	2
- P3	8	2
- P4	7	1

**Multilevel Queue**

- The ready queue consists of multiple queues
- Multilevel queue scheduler defined by the following parameters:
  - Number of queues
  - Scheduling algorithms for each queue
  - Method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that process needs service
  - Scheduling among the queues


**Multilevel Queue**

- With priority scheduling, have separate queues for each priority.
- Schedule the process in the highest-priority queue!

**Multilevel Feedback Queue**

- A process can move between the various queues.
- Multilevel-feedback-queue scheduler defined by the following parameters:
  - Number of queues
  - Scheduling algorithms for each queue
  - Method used to determine when to upgrade a process
  - Method used to determine when to demote a process
  - Method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that process needs service
- Aging can be implemented using multilevel feedback queue


**Example of Multilevel Feedback Queue**

- Three queues:
  - Q0 – RR with time quantum 8 milliseconds
  - Q1 – RR time quantum 16 milliseconds
  - Q2 – FCFS
- Scheduling
  - A new process enters queue Q0 which is served in RR
    - When it gains CPU, the process receives 8 milliseconds
    - If it does not finish in 8 milliseconds, the process  is moved to queue Q1
  - At Q1 job is again served in RR and receives 16 additional milliseconds
    - If it still does not complete, it is preempted and moved to queue Q2

per time unit, called throughput. For long processes, this rate may be
one process over several seconds; for short transactions, it may be tens of
processes per second.
• Turnaround time. From the point of view of a particular process, the
important criterion is how long it takes to execute that process. The interval
from the time of submission of a process to the time of completion is the
turnaround time. Turnaround time is the sum of the periods spent waiting
in the ready queue, executing on the CPU, and doing I/O.
• Waiting time. The CPU-scheduling algorithm does not affect the amount
of time during which a process executes or does I/O. It affects only the
amount of time that a process spends waiting in the ready queue. Waiting
time is the sum of the periods spent waiting in the ready queue.
• Response time. In an interactive system, turnaround time may not be
the best criterion. Often, a process can produce some output fairly early
and can continue computing new results while previous results are being
output to the user. Thus, another measure is the time from the submission
of a request until the first response is produced. This measure, called
response time, is the time it takes to start responding, not the time it takes
to output the response.
It is desirable to maximize CPU utilization and throughput and to minimize
turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. In most cases, we optimize
the average measure. However, under some circumstances, we prefer to opti-
mize the minimum or maximum values rather than the average. For example,
to guarantee that all users get good service, we may want to minimize the
maximum response time.
Investigators have suggested that, for interactive systems (such as a PC
desktop or laptop system), it is more important to minimize the variance in
the response time than to minimize the average response time. A system with
reasonable and predictable response time may be considered more desirable
than a system that is faster on the average but is highly variable. However, little
work has been done on CPU-scheduling algorithms that minimize variance.
As we discuss various CPU-scheduling algorithms in the following section,
we illustrate their operation. An accurate illustration should involve many
processes, each a sequence of several hundred CPU bursts and I/O bursts.
For simplicity, though, we consider only one CPU burst (in milliseconds) per
process in our examples. Our measure of comparison is the average waiting
time. More elaborate evaluation mechanisms are discussed in Section 5.8.


## 5.3 Scheduling Algorithms

CPU scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the processes in
the ready queue is to be allocated the CPU’s core. There are many different CPU-
scheduling algorithms. In this section, we describe several of them. Although
most modern CPU architectures have multiple processing cores, we describe
these scheduling algorithms in the context of only one processing core avail-
able. That is, a single CPU that has a single processing core, thus the system is
CPU Scheduling
capable of only running one process at a time. In Section 5.5 we discuss CPU
scheduling in the context of multiprocessor systems.
First-Come, First-Served Scheduling
By far the simplest CPU-scheduling algorithm is the first-come first-serve
(FCFS) scheduling algorithm. With this scheme, the process that requests the
CPU first is allocated the CPU first. The implementation of the FCFS policy is
easily managed with a FIFO queue. When a process enters the ready queue, its
PCB is linked onto the tail of the queue. When the CPU is free, it is allocated to
the process at the head of the queue. The running process is then removed from
the queue. The code for FCFS scheduling is simple to write and understand.
On the negative side, the average waiting time under the FCFS policy is
often quite long. Consider the following set of processes that arrive at time 0,
with the length of the CPU burst given in milliseconds:
Process
Burst Time
P1
P2
P3
If the processes arrive in the order P1, P2, P3, and are served in FCFS order,
we get the result shown in the following Gantt chart, which is a bar chart that
illustrates a particular schedule, including the start and finish times of each of
the participating processes:
P1
P2
P3
The waiting time is 0 milliseconds for process P1, 24 milliseconds for process
P2, and 27 milliseconds for process P3. Thus, the average waiting time is (0
+ 24 + 27)/3 = 17 milliseconds. If the processes arrive in the order P2, P3, P1,
however, the results will be as shown in the following Gantt chart:
P1
P2
P3
The average waiting time is now (6 + 0 + 3)/3 = 3 milliseconds. This reduction
is substantial. Thus, the average waiting time under an FCFS policy is generally
not minimal and may vary substantially if the processes’ CPU burst times vary
greatly.
In addition, consider the performance of FCFS scheduling in a dynamic
situation. Assume we have one CPU-bound process and many I/O-bound pro-
cesses. As the processes flow around the system, the following scenario may
result. The CPU-bound process will get and hold the CPU. During this time, all
the other processes will finish their I/O and will move into the ready queue,
waiting for the CPU. While the processes wait in the ready queue, the I/O


## 5.3 Scheduling Algorithms

devices are idle. Eventually, the CPU-bound process finishes its CPU burst and
moves to an I/O device. All the I/O-bound processes, which have short CPU
bursts, execute quickly and move back to the I/O queues. At this point, the
CPU sits idle. The CPU-bound process will then move back to the ready queue
and be allocated the CPU. Again, all the I/O processes end up waiting in the
ready queue until the CPU-bound process is done. There is a convoy effect as
all the other processes wait for the one big process to get off the CPU. This effect
results in lower CPU and device utilization than might be possible if the shorter
processes were allowed to go first.
Note also that the FCFS scheduling algorithm is nonpreemptive. Once the
CPU has been allocated to a process, that process keeps the CPU until it releases
the CPU, either by terminating or by requesting I/O. The FCFS algorithm is thus
particularly troublesome for interactive systems, where it is important that
each process get a share of the CPU at regular intervals. It would be disastrous
to allow one process to keep the CPU for an extended period.
Shortest-Job-First Scheduling
A different approach to CPU scheduling is the shortest-job-firs (SJF) schedul-
ing algorithm. This algorithm associates with each process the length of the
process’s next CPU burst. When the CPU is available, it is assigned to the process
that has the smallest next CPU burst. If the next CPU bursts of two processes are
the same, FCFS scheduling is used to break the tie. Note that a more appro-
priate term for this scheduling method would be the shortest-next-CPU-burst
algorithm, because scheduling depends on the length of the next CPU burst of
a process, rather than its total length. We use the term SJF because most people
and textbooks use this term to refer to this type of scheduling.
As an example of SJF scheduling, consider the following set of processes,
with the length of the CPU burst given in milliseconds:
Process
Burst Time
P1
P2
P3
P4
Using SJF scheduling, we would schedule these processes according to the
following Gantt chart:
P3
P2
P4
P1
The waiting time is 3 milliseconds for process P1, 16 milliseconds for process
P2, 9 milliseconds for process P3, and 0 milliseconds for process P4. Thus, the
average waiting time is (3 + 16 + 9 + 0)/4 = 7 milliseconds. By comparison, if
we were using the FCFS scheduling scheme, the average waiting time would
be 10.25 milliseconds.
The SJF scheduling algorithm is provably optimal, in that it gives the mini-
mum average waiting time for a given set of processes. Moving a short process
CPU Scheduling
before a long one decreases the waiting time of the short process more than
it increases the waiting time of the long process. Consequently, the average
waiting time decreases.
Although the SJF algorithm is optimal, it cannot be implemented at the level
of CPU scheduling, as there is no way to know the length of the next CPU burst.
One approach to this problem is to try to approximate SJF scheduling. We may
not know the length of the next CPU burst, but we may be able to predict its
value. We expect that the next CPU burst will be similar in length to the previous
ones. By computing an approximation of the length of the next CPU burst, we
can pick the process with the shortest predicted CPU burst.
The next CPU burst is generally predicted as an exponential average of
the measured lengths of previous CPU bursts. We can define the exponential
average with the following formula. Let tn be the length of the nth CPU burst,
and let τn+1 be our predicted value for the next CPU burst. Then, for α, 0 ≤α ≤
1, define
τn+1 = α tn + (1 −α)τn.
The value of tn contains our most recent information, while τn stores the past
history. The parameter α controls the relative weight of recent and past history
in our prediction. If α = 0, then τn+1 = τn, and recent history has no effect
(current conditions are assumed to be transient). If α = 1, then τn+1 = tn, and
only the most recent CPU burst matters (history is assumed to be old and
irrelevant). More commonly, α = 1/2, so recent history and past history are
equally weighted. The initial τ0 can be defined as a constant or as an overall
system average. Figure 5.4 shows an exponential average with α = 1/2 and
τ0 = 10.

## 5.3 Scheduling Algorithms

To understand the behavior of the exponential average, we can expand the
formula for τn+1 by substituting for τn to find
τn+1 = αtn + (1 −α)αtn−1 + · · · + (1 −α)jαtn−j + · · · + (1 −α)n+1τ0.
Typically, α is less than 1. As a result, (1 −α) is also less than 1, and each
successive term has less weight than its predecessor.
The SJF algorithm can be either preemptive or nonpreemptive. The choice
arises when a new process arrives at the ready queue while a previous pro-
cess is still executing. The next CPU burst of the newly arrived process may
be shorter than what is left of the currently executing process. A preemptive
SJF algorithm will preempt the currently executing process, whereas a non-
preemptive SJF algorithm will allow the currently running process to finish its
CPU burst. Preemptive SJF scheduling is sometimes called shortest-remaining-
time-firs scheduling.
As an example, consider the following four processes, with the length of
the CPU burst given in milliseconds:
Process
Arrival Time
Burst Time
P1
P2
P3
P4
If the processes arrive at the ready queue at the times shown and need the
indicated burst times, then the resulting preemptive SJF schedule is as depicted
in the following Gantt chart:
P1
P3
P1
P2
P4
Process P1 is started at time 0, since it is the only process in the queue. Process
P2 arrives at time 1. The remaining time for process P1 (7 milliseconds) is
larger than the time required by process P2 (4 milliseconds), so process P1 is
preempted, and process P2 is scheduled. The average waiting time for this
example is [(10 −1) + (1 −1) + (17 −2) + (5 −3)]/4 = 26/4 = 6.5 milliseconds.
Nonpreemptive SJF scheduling would result in an average waiting time of 7.75
milliseconds.
Round-Robin Scheduling
The round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm is similar to FCFS scheduling, but
preemption is added to enable the system to switch between processes. Asmall
unit of time, called a time quantum or time slice, is defined. A time quantum
is generally from 10 to 100 milliseconds in length. The ready queue is treated as
a circular queue. The CPU scheduler goes around the ready queue, allocating
the CPU to each process for a time interval of up to 1 time quantum.
To implement RR scheduling, we again treat the ready queue as a FIFO
queue of processes. New processes are added to the tail of the ready queue.
CPU Scheduling
The CPU scheduler picks the first process from the ready queue, sets a timer to
interrupt after 1 time quantum, and dispatches the process.
One of two things will then happen. The process may have a CPU burst of
less than 1 time quantum. In this case, the process itself will release the CPU
voluntarily. The scheduler will then proceed to the next process in the ready
queue. If the CPU burst of the currently running process is longer than 1 time
quantum, the timer will go off and will cause an interrupt to the operating
system. A context switch will be executed, and the process will be put at the
tail of the ready queue. The CPU scheduler will then select the next process in
the ready queue.
The average waiting time under the RR policy is often long. Consider the
following set of processes that arrive at time 0, with the length of the CPU burst
given in milliseconds:
Process
Burst Time
P1
P2
P3
If we use a time quantum of 4 milliseconds, then process P1 gets the first 4
milliseconds. Since it requires another 20 milliseconds, it is preempted after
the first time quantum, and the CPU is given to the next process in the queue,
process P2. Process P2 does not need 4 milliseconds, so it quits before its time
quantum expires. The CPU is then given to the next process, process P3. Once
each process has received 1 time quantum, the CPU is returned to process P1
for an additional time quantum. The resulting RR schedule is as follows:
P1
P1
P1
P1
P1
P1
P2
P3
Let’s calculate the average waiting time for this schedule. P1 waits for 6 mil-
liseconds (10 −4), P2 waits for 4 milliseconds, and P3 waits for 7 milliseconds.
Thus, the average waiting time is 17/3 = 5.66 milliseconds.
In the RR scheduling algorithm, no process is allocated the CPU for more
than 1 time quantum in a row (unless it is the only runnable process). If a
process’s CPU burst exceeds 1 time quantum, that process is preempted and is
put back in the ready queue. The RR scheduling algorithm is thus preemptive.
If there are n processes in the ready queue and the time quantum is q, then
each process gets 1/n of the CPU time in chunks of at most q time units. Each
process must wait no longer than (n −1) × q time units until its next time quan-
tum. For example, with five processes and a time quantum of 20 milliseconds,
each process will get up to 20 milliseconds every 100 milliseconds.
The performance of the RR algorithm depends heavily on the size of the
time quantum. At one extreme, if the time quantum is extremely large, the
RR policy is the same as the FCFS policy. In contrast, if the time quantum is
extremely small (say, 1 millisecond), the RR approach can result in a large

number of context switches. Assume, for example, that we have only one
process of 10 time units. If the quantum is 12 time units, the process finishes
in less than 1 time quantum, with no overhead. If the quantum is 6 time units,
however, the process requires 2 quanta, resulting in a context switch. If the
time quantum is 1 time unit, then nine context switches will occur, slowing the
execution of the process accordingly (Figure 5.5).
Thus, we want the time quantum to be large with respect to the context-
switch time. If the context-switch time is approximately 10 percent of the
time quantum, then about 10 percent of the CPU time will be spent in context
switching. In practice, most modern systems have time quanta ranging from
10 to 100 milliseconds. The time required for a context switch is typically less
than 10 microseconds; thus, the context-switch time is a small fraction of the
time quantum.
Turnaround time also depends on the size of the time quantum. As we
can see from Figure 5.6, the average turnaround time of a set of processes
does not necessarily improve as the time-quantum size increases. In general,
the average turnaround time can be improved if most processes finish their
next CPU burst in a single time quantum. For example, given three processes
of 10 time units each and a quantum of 1 time unit, the average turnaround
time is 29. If the time quantum is 10, however, the average turnaround time
drops to 20. If context-switch time is added in, the average turnaround time
increases even more for a smaller time quantum, since more context switches
are required.
Although the time quantum should be large compared with the context-
switch time, it should not be too large. As we pointed out earlier, if the time
quantum is too large, RR scheduling degenerates to an FCFS policy. A rule of
thumb is that 80 percent of the CPU bursts should be shorter than the time
quantum.
Priority Scheduling
The SJF algorithm is a special case of the general priority-scheduling algorithm.
A priority is associated with each process, and the CPU is allocated to the

process with the highest priority. Equal-priority processes are scheduled in
FCFS order. An SJF algorithm is simply a priority algorithm where the priority
(p) is the inverse of the (predicted) next CPU burst. The larger the CPU burst,
the lower the priority, and vice versa.
Note that we discuss scheduling in terms of high priority and low priority.
Priorities are generally indicated by some fixed range of numbers, such as 0
to 7 or 0 to 4,095. However, there is no general agreement on whether 0 is the
highest or lowest priority. Some systems use low numbers to represent low
priority; others use low numbers for high priority. This difference can lead to
confusion. In this text, we assume that low numbers represent high priority.
As an example, consider the following set of processes, assumed to have
arrived at time 0 in the order P1, P2, · · ·, P5, with the length of the CPU burst
given in milliseconds:
Process
Burst Time
Priority
P1
P2

Using priority scheduling, we would schedule these processes according to the
following Gantt chart:

The average waiting time is 8.2 milliseconds.
Priorities can be defined either internally or externally. Internally defined
priorities use some measurable quantity or quantities to compute the priority
of a process. For example, time limits, memory requirements, the number of
open files, and the ratio of average I/O burst to average CPU burst have been
used in computing priorities. External priorities are set by criteria outside the
operating system, such as the importance of the process, the type and amount
of funds being paid for computer use, the department sponsoring the work,
and other, often political, factors.
Priority scheduling can be either preemptive or nonpreemptive. When a
process arrives at the ready queue, its priority is compared with the priority of
the currently running process. Apreemptive priority scheduling algorithm will
preempt the CPU if the priority of the newly arrived process is higher than the
priority of the currently running process. Anonpreemptive priority scheduling
algorithm will simply put the new process at the head of the ready queue.
A major problem with priority scheduling algorithms is indefinit block-
ing, or starvation. A process that is ready to run but waiting for the CPU can
be considered blocked. A priority scheduling algorithm can leave some low-
priority processes waiting indefinitely. In a heavily loaded computer system, a
steady stream of higher-priority processes can prevent a low-priority process
from ever getting the CPU. Generally, one of two things will happen. Either
the process will eventually be run (at 2 A.M. Sunday, when the system is finally
lightly loaded), or the computer system will eventually crash and lose all unfin-
ished low-priority processes. (Rumor has it that when they shut down the IBM
7094 at MIT in 1973, they found a low-priority process that had been submitted
in 1967 and had not yet been run.)
Asolution to the problem of indefinite blockage of low-priority processes is
aging. Aging involves gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait
in the system for a long time. For example, if priorities range from 127 (low)
to 0 (high), we could periodically (say, every second) increase the priority of
a waiting process by 1. Eventually, even a process with an initial priority of
127 would have the highest priority in the system and would be executed. In
fact, it would take a little over 2 minutes for a priority-127 process to age to a
priority-0 process.
Another option is to combine round-robin and priority scheduling in such
a way that the system executes the highest-priority process and runs processes
with the same priority using round-robin scheduling. Let’s illustrate with an
example using the following set of processes, with the burst time in millisec-
onds:
Process
Burst Time
Priority
P1
P2
P3
P4
P5
CPU Scheduling
Using priority scheduling with round-robin for processes with equal priority,
we would schedule these processes according to the following Gantt chart
using a time quantum of 2 milliseconds:
P4
P2
P3
P2
P3
P2
P3
P1
P5
P1
P5
In this example, process P4 has the highest priority, so it will run to comple-
tion. Processes P2 and P3 have the next-highest priority, and they will execute in
a round-robin fashion. Notice that when process P2 finishes at time 16, process
P3 is the highest-priority process, so it will run until it completes execution.
Now, only processes P1 and P5 remain, and as they have equal priority, they
will execute in round-robin order until they complete.
Multilevel Queue Scheduling
With both priority and round-robin scheduling, all processes may be placed
in a single queue, and the scheduler then selects the process with the highest
priority to run. Depending on how the queues are managed, an O(n) search
may be necessary to determine the highest-priority process. In practice, it is
often easier to have separate queues for each distinct priority, and priority
scheduling simply schedules the process in the highest-priority queue. This
is illustrated in Figure 5.7. This approach—known as multilevel queue—
also works well when priority scheduling is combined with round-robin: if
there are multiple processes in the highest-priority queue, they are executed in
round-robin order. In the most generalized form of this approach, a priority is
assigned statically to each process, and a process remains in the same queue
for the duration of its runtime.

Figure 5.8
Multilevel queue scheduling.
A multilevel queue scheduling algorithm can also be used to partition
processes into several separate queues based on the process type (Figure
5.8). For example, a common division is made between foreground (interac-
tive) processes and background (batch) processes. These two types of pro-
cesses have different response-time requirements and so may have different
scheduling needs. In addition, foreground processes may have priority (exter-
nally defined) over background processes. Separate queues might be used for
foreground and background processes, and each queue might have its own
scheduling algorithm. The foreground queue might be scheduled by an RR
algorithm, for example, while the background queue is scheduled by an FCFS
algorithm.
In addition, there must be scheduling among the queues, which is com-
monly implemented as fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. For example, the
real-time queue may have absolute priority over the interactive queue.
Let’s look at an example of a multilevel queue scheduling algorithm with
four queues, listed below in order of priority:
1. Real-time processes
2. System processes
3. Interactive processes
4. Batch processes
Each queue has absolute priority over lower-priority queues. No process in the
batch queue, for example, could run unless the queues for real-time processes,
system processes, and interactive processes were all empty. If an interactive
process entered the ready queue while a batch process was running, the batch
process would be preempted.
Another possibility is to time-slice among the queues. Here, each queue
gets a certain portion of the CPU time, which it can then schedule among its var-
ious processes. For instance, in the foreground–background queue example,
the foreground queue can be given 80 percent of the CPU time for RR scheduling
CPU Scheduling
among its processes, while the background queue receives 20 percent of the
CPU to give to its processes on an FCFS basis.
Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling
Normally, when the multilevel queue scheduling algorithm is used, processes
are permanently assigned to a queue when they enter the system. If there
are separate queues for foreground and background processes, for example,
processes do not move from one queue to the other, since processes do not
change their foreground or background nature. This setup has the advantage
of low scheduling overhead, but it is inflexible.
The multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm, in contrast, allows
a process to move between queues. The idea is to separate processes according
to the characteristics of their CPU bursts. If a process uses too much CPU time,
it will be moved to a lower-priority queue. This scheme leaves I/O-bound and
interactive processes—which are typically characterized by short CPU bursts
—in the higher-priority queues. In addition, a process that waits too long in a
lower-priority queue may be moved to a higher-priority queue. This form of
aging prevents starvation.
For example, consider a multilevel feedback queue scheduler with three
queues, numbered from 0 to 2 (Figure 5.9). The scheduler first executes all
processes in queue 0. Only when queue 0 is empty will it execute processes
in queue 1. Similarly, processes in queue 2 will be executed only if queues 0
and 1 are empty. A process that arrives for queue 1 will preempt a process in
queue 2. A process in queue 1 will in turn be preempted by a process arriving
for queue 0.
An entering process is put in queue 0. A process in queue 0 is given a time
quantum of 8 milliseconds. If it does not finish within this time, it is moved
to the tail of queue 1. If queue 0 is empty, the process at the head of queue 1 is
given a quantum of 16 milliseconds. If it does not complete, it is preempted and
is put into queue 2. Processes in queue 2 are run on an FCFS basis but are run
only when queues 0 and 1 are empty. To prevent starvation, a process that waits
too long in a lower-priority queue may gradually be moved to a higher-priority
queue.

## 5.4 Thread Scheduling
> id: ch05-5-4 | src: book 5.4; slides 33-45 | kind: concept

This scheduling algorithm gives highest priority to any process with a CPU
burst of 8 milliseconds or less. Such a process will quickly get the CPU, finish
its CPU burst, and go off to its next I/O burst. Processes that need more than
8 but less than 24 milliseconds are also served quickly, although with lower
priority than shorter processes. Long processes automatically sink to queue
2 and are served in FCFS order with any CPU cycles left over from queues 0
and 1.
In general, a multilevel feedback queue scheduler is defined by the follow-
ing parameters:
• The number of queues
• The scheduling algorithm for each queue
• The method used to determine when to upgrade a process to a higher-
priority queue
• The method used to determine when to demote a process to a lower-
priority queue
• The method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that
process needs service
The definition of a multilevel feedback queue scheduler makes it the most
general CPU-scheduling algorithm. It can be configured to match a specific
system under design. Unfortunately, it is also the most complex algorithm,
since defining the best scheduler requires some means by which to select values
for all the parameters.

**Multiple-Processor Scheduling – Load Balancing**

- If SMP, need to keep all CPUs loaded for efficiency
- Load balancing attempts to keep workload evenly distributed
- Push migration – periodic task checks load on each processor, and if found pushes task from overloaded CPU to other CPUs
- Pull migration – idle processors pulls waiting task from busy processor


**Multiple-Processor Scheduling – Processor Affinity**

- When a thread has been running on one processor, the cache contents of that processor stores the memory accesses by that thread.
- We refer to this as a thread having affinity for a processor (i.e., “processor affinity”)
- Load balancing may affect processor affinity as a thread may be moved from one processor to another to balance loads, yet that thread loses the contents of what it had in the cache of the processor it was moved off of.
- Soft affinity – the operating system attempts to keep a thread running on the same processor, but no guarantees.
- Hard affinity – allows a process to specify a set of processors it may run on.


**NUMA and CPU Scheduling**

- If the operating system is NUMA-aware, it will assign memory closes to the CPU the thread is running on.

## 5.4 Thread Scheduling
> id: ch05-5-4 | src: book 5.4 | kind: concept

In Chapter 4, we introduced threads to the process model, distinguishing
between user-level and kernel-level threads. On most modern operating sys-
tems it is kernel-level threads—not processes—that are being scheduled by
the operating system. User-level threads are managed by a thread library, and
the kernel is unaware of them. To run on a CPU, user-level threads must ulti-
mately be mapped to an associated kernel-level thread, although this mapping
may be indirect and may use a lightweight process (LWP). In this section, we
explore scheduling issues involving user-level and kernel-level threads and
offer specific examples of scheduling for Pthreads.
Contention Scope
One distinction between user-level and kernel-level threads lies in how they
are scheduled. On systems implementing the many-to-one (Section 4.3.1)
and many-to-many (Section 4.3.3) models, the thread library schedules user-
level threads to run on an available LWP. This scheme is known as process-
contention scope (PCS), since competition for the CPU takes place among
threads belonging to the same process. (When we say the thread library sched-
ules user threads onto available LWPs, we do not mean that the threads are
actually running on a CPU as that further requires the operating system to
schedule the LWP’s kernel thread onto a physical CPU core.) To decide which
CPU Scheduling
kernel-level thread to schedule onto a CPU, the kernel uses system-contention
scope (SCS). Competition for the CPU with SCS scheduling takes place among
all threads in the system. Systems using the one-to-one model (Section 4.3.2),
such as Windows and Linux schedule threads using only SCS.
Typically, PCS is done according to priority—the scheduler selects the
runnable thread with the highest priority to run. User-level thread priorities
are set by the programmer and are not adjusted by the thread library, although
some thread libraries may allow the programmer to change the priority of
a thread. It is important to note that PCS will typically preempt the thread
currently running in favor of a higher-priority thread; however, there is no
guarantee of time slicing (Section 5.3.3) among threads of equal priority.
Pthread Scheduling
We provided a sample POSIX Pthread program in Section 4.4.1, along with an
introduction to thread creation with Pthreads. Now, we highlight the POSIX
Pthread API that allows specifying PCS or SCS during thread creation. Pthreads
identifies the following contention scope values:
• PTHREAD SCOPE PROCESS schedules threads using PCS scheduling.
• PTHREAD SCOPE SYSTEM schedules threads using SCS scheduling.
On
systems
implementing
the
many-to-many
model,
the
PTHREAD SCOPE PROCESS policy schedules user-level threads onto available
LWPs. The number of LWPs is maintained by the thread library, perhaps using
scheduler activations (Section 4.6.5). The PTHREAD SCOPE SYSTEM scheduling
policy will create and bind an LWP for each user-level thread on many-to-many
systems, effectively mapping threads using the one-to-one policy.
The Pthread IPC (Interprocess Communication) provides two functions for
setting—and getting—the contention scope policy:
• pthread attr setscope(pthread attr t *attr, int scope)
• pthread attr getscope(pthread attr t *attr, int *scope)
The first parameter for both functions contains a pointer to the attribute set for
the thread. The second parameter for the pthread attr setscope() function
is passed either the PTHREAD SCOPE SYSTEM or the PTHREAD SCOPE PROCESS
value, indicating how the contention scope is to be set. In the case of
pthread attr getscope(), this second parameter contains a pointer to an
int value that is set to the current value of the contention scope. If an error
occurs, each of these functions returns a nonzero value.
In Figure 5.10, we illustrate a Pthread scheduling
API. The pro-
gram

contention scope values are allowed. For example, Linux and macOS systems
allow only PTHREAD SCOPE SYSTEM.

## 5.5 Multi-Processor Scheduling
> id: ch05-5-5 | src: book 5.5 | kind: concept

Our discussion thus far has focused on the problems of scheduling the CPU in a
system with a single processing core. If multiple CPUs are available, load shar-
ing, where multiple threads may run in parallel, becomes possible, however
scheduling issues become correspondingly more complex. Many possibilities
have been tried; and as we saw with CPU scheduling with a single-core CPU,
there is no one best solution.
Traditionally, the term multiprocessor referred to systems that provided
multiple physical processors, where each processor contained one single-core
CPU. However, the definition of multiprocessor has evolved significantly, and
on modern computing systems, multiprocessor now applies to the following
system architectures:
• Multicore CPUs
• Multithreaded cores
• NUMA systems
• Heterogeneous multiprocessing
Here, we discuss several concerns in multiprocessor scheduling in the con-
text of these different architectures. In the first three examples we concentrate
on systems in which the processors are identical—homogeneous—in terms of
their functionality. We can then use any available CPU to run any process in the
queue. In the last example we explore a system where the processors are not
identical in their capabilities.
Approaches to Multiple-Processor Scheduling
One approach to CPU scheduling in a multiprocessor system has all scheduling
decisions, I/O processing, and other system activities handled by a single
processor — the master server. The other processors execute only user code.
This asymmetric multiprocessing is simple because only one core accesses the
system data structures, reducing the need for data sharing. The downfall of
this approach is the master server becomes a potential bottleneck where overall
system performance may be reduced.
The standard approach for supporting multiprocessors is symmetric mul-
tiprocessing (SMP), where each processor is self-scheduling. Scheduling pro-
ceeds by having the scheduler for each processor examine the ready queue
and select a thread to run. Note that this provides two possible strategies for
organizing the threads eligible to be scheduled:
1. All threads may be in a common ready queue.
2. Each processor may have its own private queue of threads.
These two strategies are contrasted in Figure 5.11. If we select the first
option, we have a possible race condition on the shared ready queue and
therefore must ensure that two separate processors do not choose to schedule
the same thread and that threads are not lost from the queue. As discussed in

Chapter 6, we could use some form of locking to protect the common ready
queue from this race condition. Locking would be highly contended, however,
as all accesses to the queue would require lock ownership, and accessing the
shared queue would likely be a performance bottleneck. The second option
permits each processor to schedule threads from its private run queue and
therefore does not suffer from the possible performance problems associated
with a shared run queue. Thus, it is the most common approach on systems
supporting SMP. Additionally, as described in Section 5.5.4, having private, per-
processor run queues in fact may lead to more efficient use of cache memory.
There are issues with per-processor run queues—most notably, workloads of
varying sizes. However, as we shall see, balancing algorithms can be used to
equalize workloads among all processors.
Virtually all modern operating systems support SMP, including Windows,
Linux, and macOS as well as mobile systems including Android and iOS. In
the remainder of this section, we discuss issues concerning SMP systems when
designing CPU scheduling algorithms.
Multicore Processors
Traditionally, SMP systems have allowed several processes to run in parallel by
providing multiple physical processors. However, most contemporary com-
puter hardware now places multiple computing cores on the same physical
chip, resulting in a multicore processor. Each core maintains its architectural
state and thus appears to the operating system to be a separate logical CPU.
SMP systems that use multicore processors are faster and consume less power
than systems in which each CPU has its own physical chip.
Multicore processors may complicate scheduling issues. Let’s consider
how this can happen. Researchers have discovered that when a processor
accesses memory, it spends a significant amount of time waiting for the data to
become available. This situation, known as a memory stall, occurs primarily
because modern processors operate at much faster speeds than memory. How-
ever, a memory stall can also occur because of a cache miss (accessing data
that are not in cache memory). Figure 5.12 illustrates a memory stall. In this
scenario, the processor can spend up to 50 percent of its time waiting for data
to become available from memory.

Memory stall.
To remedy this situation, many recent hardware designs have imple-
mented multithreaded processing cores in which two (or more) hardware
threads are assigned to each core. That way, if one hardware thread stalls while
waiting for memory, the core can switch to another thread. Figure 5.13 illus-
trates a dual-threaded processing core on which the execution of thread 0 and
the execution of thread 1 are interleaved. From an operating system perspec-
tive, each hardware thread maintains its architectural state, such as instruction
pointer and register set, and thus appears as a logical CPU that is available to
run a software thread. This technique—known as chip multithreading (CMT)
—is illustrated in Figure 5.14. Here, the processor contains four computing
cores, with each core containing two hardware threads. From the perspective
of the operating system, there are eight logical CPUs.
Intel processors use the term hyper-threading (also known as simultane-
ous multithreading or SMT) to describe assigning multiple hardware threads to
a single processing core. Contemporary Intel processors—such as the i7—sup-
port two threads per core, while the Oracle Sparc M7 processor supports eight
threads per core, with eight cores per processor, thus providing the operating
system with 64 logical CPUs.
In general, there are two ways to multithread a processing core: coarse-
grained and fine-graine
multithreading. With coarse-grained multithread-
ing, a thread executes on a core until a long-latency event such as a memory
stall occurs. Because of the delay caused by the long-latency event, the core
must switch to another thread to begin execution. However, the cost of switch-
ing between threads is high, since the instruction pipeline must be flushed
before the other thread can begin execution on the processor core. Once this
new thread begins execution, it begins filling the pipeline with its instructions.
Fine-grained (or interleaved) multithreading switches between threads at a
much finer level of granularity—typically at the boundary of an instruction

cycle. However, the architectural design of fine-grained systems includes logic
for thread switching. As a result, the cost of switching between threads is small.
It is important to note that the resources of the physical core (such as caches
and pipelines) must be shared among its hardware threads, and therefore a
processing core can only execute one hardware thread at a time. Consequently,
a multithreaded, multicore processor actually requires two different levels of
scheduling, as shown in Figure 5.15, which illustrates a dual-threaded process-
ing core.
On one level are the scheduling decisions that must be made by the oper-
ating system as it chooses which software thread to run on each hardware
thread (logical CPU). For all practical purposes, such decisions have been the
primary focus of this chapter. Therefore, for this level of scheduling, the oper-
ating system may choose any scheduling algorithm, including those described
in Section 5.3.
A second level of scheduling specifies how each core decides which hard-
ware thread to run. There are several strategies to adopt in this situation. One
approach is to use a simple round-robin algorithm to schedule a hardware
thread to the processing core. This is the approach adopted by the UltraSPARC
T3. Another approach is used by the Intel Itanium, a dual-core processor with
two hardware-managed threads per core. Assigned to each hardware thread is
a dynamic urgency value ranging from 0 to 7, with 0 representing the lowest
urgency and 7 the highest. The Itanium identifies five different events that may

trigger a thread switch. When one of these events occurs, the thread-switching
logic compares the urgency of the two threads and selects the thread with the
highest urgency value to execute on the processor core.
Note that the two different levels of scheduling shown in Figure 5.15 are
not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, if the operating system scheduler
(the first level) is made aware of the sharing of processor resources, it can make
more effective scheduling decisions. As an example, assume that a CPU has
two processing cores, and each core has two hardware threads. If two software
threads are running on this system, they can be running either on the same core
or on separate cores. If they are both scheduled to run on the same core, they
have to share processor resources and thus are likely to proceed more slowly
than if they were scheduled on separate cores. If the operating system is aware
of the level of processor resource sharing, it can schedule software threads onto
logical processors that do not share resources.
Load Balancing
On SMP systems, it is important to keep the workload balanced among all
processors to fully utilize the benefits of having more than one processor. Oth-
erwise, one or more processors may sit idle while other processors have high
workloads, along with ready queues of threads awaiting the CPU. Load balanc-
ing attempts to keep the workload evenly distributed across all processors in
an SMP system. It is important to note that load balancing is typically necessary
only on systems where each processor has its own private ready queue of eligi-
ble threads to execute. On systems with a common run queue, load balancing
is unnecessary, because once a processor becomes idle, it immediately extracts
a runnable thread from the common ready queue.
There are two general approaches to load balancing: push migration and
pull migration. With push migration, a specific task periodically checks the
load on each processor and—if it finds an imbalance—evenly distributes the
load by moving (or pushing) threads from overloaded to idle or less-busy
processors. Pull migration occurs when an idle processor pulls a waiting task
from a busy processor. Push and pull migration need not be mutually exclusive
and are, in fact, often implemented in parallel on load-balancing systems. For

example, the Linux CFS scheduler (described in Section 5.7.1) and the ULE
scheduler available for FreeBSD systems implement both techniques.
The concept of a “balanced load” may have different meanings. One view
of a balanced load may require simply that all queues have approximately the
same number of threads. Alternatively, balance may require an equal distri-
bution of thread priorities across all queues. In addition, in certain situations,
neither of these strategies may be sufficient. Indeed, they may work against the
goals of the scheduling algorithm. (We leave further consideration of this as an
exercise.)
Processor Afﬁnity
Consider what happens to cache memory when a thread has been running on a
specific processor. The data most recently accessed by the thread populate the
cache for the processor. As a result, successive memory accesses by the thread
are often satisfied in cache memory (known as a “warm cache”). Now consider
what happens if the thread migrates to another processor—say, due to load
balancing. The contents of cache memory must be invalidated for the first pro-
cessor, and the cache for the second processor must be repopulated. Because of
the high cost of invalidating and repopulating caches, most operating systems
with SMP support try to avoid migrating a thread from one processor to another
and instead attempt to keep a thread running on the same processor and take
advantage of a warm cache. This is known as processor affinit —that is, a
process has an affinity for the processor on which it is currently running.
The two strategies described in Section 5.5.1 for organizing the queue of
threads available for scheduling have implications for processor affinity. If we
adopt the approach of a common ready queue, a thread may be selected for
execution by any processor. Thus, if a thread is scheduled on a new processor,
that processor’s cache must be repopulated. With private, per-processor ready
queues, a thread is always scheduled on the same processor and can therefore
benefit from the contents of a warm cache. Essentially, per-processor ready
queues provide processor affinity for free!
Processor affinity takes several forms. When an operating system has a
policy of attempting to keep a process running on the same processor—but
not guaranteeing that it will do so—we have a situation known as soft affinit .
Here, the operating system will attempt to keep a process on a single processor,
but it is possible for a process to migrate between processors during load
balancing. In contrast, some systems provide system calls that support hard
affinit , thereby allowing a process to specify a subset of processors on which it
can run. Many systems provide both soft and hard affinity. For example, Linux
implements soft affinity, but it also provides the sched setaffinity() system
call, which supports hard affinity by allowing a thread to specify the set of CPUs
on which it is eligible to run.
The main-memory architecture of a system can affect processor affinity
issues as well. Figure 5.16 illustrates an architecture featuring non-uniform
memory access (NUMA) where there are two physical processor chips each with
their own CPU and local memory. Although a system interconnect allows all
CPUs in a NUMA system to share one physical address space, a CPU has faster
access to its local memory than to memory local to another CPU. If the operating
system’s CPU scheduler and memory-placement algorithms are NUMA-aware

and work together, then a thread that has been scheduled onto a particular CPU
can be allocated memory closest to where the CPU resides, thus providing the
thread the fastest possible memory access.
Interestingly, load balancing often counteracts the benefits of processor
affinity. That is, the benefit of keeping a thread running on the same processor
is that the thread can take advantage of its data being in that processor’s cache
memory. Balancing loads by moving a thread from one processor to another
removes this benefit. Similarly, migrating a thread between processors may
incur a penalty on NUMAsystems, where a thread may be moved to a processor
that requires longer memory access times. In other words, there is a natural
tension between load balancing and minimizing memory access times. Thus,
scheduling algorithms for modern multicore NUMAsystems have become quite
complex. In Section 5.7.1, we examine the Linux CFS scheduling algorithm and
explore how it balances these competing goals.
Heterogeneous Multiprocessing
In the examples we have discussed so far, all processors are identical in terms
of their capabilities, thus allowing any thread to run on any processing core.
The only difference being that memory access times may vary based upon load
balancing and processor affinity policies, as well as on NUMA systems.
Although mobile systems now include multicore architectures, some sys-
tems are now designed using cores that run the same instruction set, yet vary
in terms of their clock speed and power management, including the ability to
adjust the power consumption of a core to the point of idling the core. Such
systems are known as heterogeneous multiprocessing (HMP). Note this is not
a form of asymmetric multiprocessing as described in Section 5.5.1 as both
system and user tasks can run on any core. Rather, the intention behind HMP is
to better manage power consumption by assigning tasks to certain cores based
upon the specific demands of the task.
For ARM processors that support it, this type of architecture is known
as big.LITTLE where higher-peformance big cores are combined with energy
efficient LITTLE cores. Big cores consume greater energy and therefore should


## 5.6 Real-Time CPU Scheduling
> id: ch05-5-6 | src: book 5.6; slides 46-72 | kind: concept

only be used for short periods of time. Likewise, little cores use less energy
and can therefore be used for longer periods.
There are several advantages to this approach. By combining a number of
slower cores with faster ones, a CPU scheduler can assign tasks that do not
require high performance, but may need to run for longer periods, (such as
background tasks) to little cores, thereby helping to preserve a battery charge.
Similarly, interactive applications which require more processing power, but
may run for shorter durations, can be assigned to big cores. Additionally, if
the mobile device is in a power-saving mode, energy-intensive big cores can
be disabled and the system can rely solely on energy-efficient little cores. Win-
dows 10 supports HMP scheduling by allowing a thread to select a scheduling
policy that best supports its power management demands.


- Can present obvious challenges
- Soft real-time systems – Critical real-time tasks have the highest priority, but no guarantee as to when tasks will be scheduled
- Hard real-time systems – task must be serviced by its deadline


- Event latency – the amount of time that elapses from when an event occurs to when it is serviced.
- Two types of latencies affect performance
  - Interrupt latency – time from arrival of interrupt to start of routine that services interrupt
  - Dispatch latency – time for schedule to take current process off CPU and switch to another

**Proportional Share Scheduling**

- T shares are allocated among all processes in the system
- An application receives N shares where N < T
- This ensures each application will receive N / T of the total processor time


**POSIX Real-Time Scheduling**

- The POSIX.1b standard
- API provides functions for managing real-time threads
- Defines two scheduling classes for real-time threads:
  - SCHED_FIFO - threads are scheduled using a FCFS strategy with a FIFO queue. There is no time-slicing for threads of equal priority
  - SCHED_RR - similar to SCHED_FIFO except time-slicing occurs for threads of equal priority
- Defines two functions for getting and setting scheduling policy:
  - pthread_attr_getsched_policy(pthread_attr_t *attr, int *policy)
  - pthread_attr_setsched_policy(pthread_attr_t *attr, int policy)


**POSIX Real-Time Scheduling API**

**Operating System Examples**

- Linux scheduling
- Windows scheduling
- Solaris scheduling


**Linux Scheduling Through Version 2.5**

- Prior to kernel version 2.5, ran variation of standard UNIX scheduling algorithm
- Version 2.5 moved to constant order O(1) scheduling time
  - Preemptive, priority based
  - Two priority ranges: time-sharing and real-time
  - Real-time range from 0 to 99 and nice value from 100 to 140
  - Map into  global priority with numerically lower values indicating higher priority
  - Higher priority gets larger q
  - Task run-able as long as time left in time slice (active)
  - If no time left (expired), not run-able until all other tasks use their slices
  - All run-able tasks tracked in per-CPU runqueue data structure
    - Two priority arrays (active, expired)
    - Tasks indexed by priority
    - When no more active, arrays are exchanged
  - Worked well, but poor response times for interactive processes


**Linux Scheduling in Version 2.6.23 +**

- Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
- Scheduling classes
  - Each has specific priority
  - Scheduler picks highest priority task in highest scheduling class
  - Rather than quantum based on fixed time allotments, based on proportion of CPU time
  - Two scheduling classes included, others can be added
    - default
    - real-time


**Linux Scheduling in Version 2.6.23 + (Cont.)**

- Quantum calculated based on nice value from -20 to +19
  - Lower value is higher priority
  - Calculates target latency – interval of time during which task should run at least once
  - Target latency can increase if say number of active tasks increases
- CFS scheduler maintains per task virtual run time in variable vruntime
  - Associated with decay factor based on priority of task – lower priority is higher decay rate
  - Normal default priority yields virtual run time = actual run time
- To decide next task to run, scheduler picks task with lowest virtual run time

## 5.6 Real-Time CPU Scheduling
> id: ch05-5-6 | src: book 5.6 | kind: concept

CPU scheduling for real-time operating systems involves special issues. In
general, we can distinguish between soft real-time systems and hard real-time
systems. Soft real-time systems provide no guarantee as to when a critical
real-time process will be scheduled. They guarantee only that the process will
be given preference over noncritical processes. Hard real-time systems have
stricter requirements. A task must be serviced by its deadline; service after the
deadline has expired is the same as no service at all. In this section, we explore
several issues related to process scheduling in both soft and hard real-time
operating systems.
Minimizing Latency
Consider the event-driven nature of a real-time system. The system is typically
waiting for an event in real time to occur. Events may arise either in software
—as when a timer expires—or in hardware—as when a remote-controlled
vehicle detects that it is approaching an obstruction. When an event occurs,
the system must respond to and service it as quickly as possible. We refer to
event latency as the amount of time that elapses from when an event occurs to
when it is serviced (Figure 5.17).

Event latency.
CPU Scheduling
Usually, different events have different latency requirements. For example,
the latency requirement for an antilock brake system might be 3 to 5 millisec-
onds. That is, from the time a wheel first detects that it is sliding, the system
controlling the antilock brakes has 3 to 5 milliseconds to respond to and control
the situation. Any response that takes longer might result in the automobile’s
veering out of control. In contrast, an embedded system controlling radar in an
airliner might tolerate a latency period of several seconds.
Two types of latencies affect the performance of real-time systems:
1. Interrupt latency
2. Dispatch latency
Interrupt latency refers to the period of time from the arrival of an interrupt
at the CPU to the start of the routine that services the interrupt. When an
interrupt occurs, the operating system must first complete the instruction it is
executing and determine the type of interrupt that occurred. It must then save
the state of the current process before servicing the interrupt using the specific
interrupt service routine (ISR). The total time required to perform these tasks is
the interrupt latency (Figure 5.18).
Obviously, it is crucial for real-time operating systems to minimize inter-
rupt latency to ensure that real-time tasks receive immediate attention. Indeed,
for hard real-time systems, interrupt latency must not simply be minimized, it
must be bounded to meet the strict requirements of these systems.
One important factor contributing to interrupt latency is the amount
of time interrupts may be disabled while kernel data structures are being
updated. Real-time operating systems require that interrupts be disabled for
only very short periods of time.
The amount of time required for the scheduling dispatcher to stop one
process and start another is known as dispatch latency. Providing real-time

tasks with immediate access to the CPU mandates that real-time operating
systems minimize this latency as well. The most effective technique for keeping
dispatch latency low is to provide preemptive kernels. For hard real-time
systems, dispatch latency is typically measured in several microseconds.
In Figure 5.19, we diagram the makeup of dispatch latency. The conflic
phase of dispatch latency has two components:
1. Preemption of any process running in the kernel
2. Release by low-priority processes of resources needed by a high-priority
process
Following the conflict phase, the dispatch phase schedules the high-priority
process onto an available CPU.
Priority-Based Scheduling
The most important feature of a real-time operating system is to respond imme-
diately to a real-time process as soon as that process requires the CPU. As a
result, the scheduler for a real-time operating system must support a priority-
based algorithm with preemption. Recall that priority-based scheduling algo-
rithms assign each process a priority based on its importance; more important
tasks are assigned higher priorities than those deemed less important. If the
scheduler also supports preemption, a process currently running on the CPU
will be preempted if a higher-priority process becomes available to run.
Preemptive, priority-based scheduling algorithms are discussed in detail in
Section 5.3.4, and Section 5.7 presents examples of the soft real-time schedul-
ing features of the Linux, Windows, and Solaris operating systems. Each of
these systems assigns real-time processes the highest scheduling priority. For

example, Windows has 32 different priority levels. The highest levels—priority
values 16 to 31—are reserved for real-time processes. Solaris and Linux have
similar prioritization schemes.
Note that providing a preemptive, priority-based scheduler only guaran-
tees soft real-time functionality. Hard real-time systems must further guarantee
that real-time tasks will be serviced in accord with their deadline requirements,
and making such guarantees requires additional scheduling features. In the
remainder of this section, we cover scheduling algorithms appropriate for hard
real-time systems.
Before we proceed with the details of the individual schedulers, however,
we must define certain characteristics of the processes that are to be scheduled.
First, the processes are considered periodic. That is, they require the CPU at
constant intervals (periods). Once a periodic process has acquired the CPU, it
has a fixed processing time t, a deadline d by which it must be serviced by the
CPU, and a period p. The relationship of the processing time, the deadline, and
the period can be expressed as 0 ≤t ≤d ≤p. The rate of a periodic task is 1∕p.
Figure 5.20 illustrates the execution of a periodic process over time. Schedulers
can take advantage of these characteristics and assign priorities according to a
process’s deadline or rate requirements.
What is unusual about this form of scheduling is that a process may have to
announce its deadline requirements to the scheduler. Then, using a technique
known as an admission-control algorithm, the scheduler does one of two
things. It either admits the process, guaranteeing that the process will complete
on time, or rejects the request as impossible if it cannot guarantee that the task
will be serviced by its deadline.
Rate-Monotonic Scheduling
The rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm schedules periodic tasks using a
static priority policy with preemption. If a lower-priority process is run-
ning and a higher-priority process becomes available to run, it will preempt
the lower-priority process. Upon entering the system, each periodic task is
assigned a priority inversely based on its period. The shorter the period, the
higher the priority; the longer the period, the lower the priority. The rationale
behind this policy is to assign a higher priority to tasks that require the CPU
more often. Furthermore, rate-monotonic scheduling assumes that the process-

ing time of a periodic process is the same for each CPU burst. That is, every time
a process acquires the CPU, the duration of its CPU burst is the same.
Let’s consider an example. We have two processes, P1 and P2. The periods
for P1 and P2 are 50 and 100, respectively—that is, p1 = 50 and p2 = 100. The
processing times are t1 = 20 for P1 and t2 = 35 for P2. The deadline for each
process requires that it complete its CPU burst by the start of its next period.
We must first ask ourselves whether it is possible to schedule these tasks
so that each meets its deadlines. If we measure the CPU utilization of a process
Pi as the ratio of its burst to its period—ti∕pi—the CPU utilization of P1 is
20∕50 = 0.40 and that of P2 is 35∕100 = 0.35, for a total CPU utilization of
75 percent. Therefore, it seems we can schedule these tasks in such a way that
both meet their deadlines and still leave the CPU with available cycles.
Suppose we assign P2 a higher priority than P1. The execution of P1 and P2
in this situation is shown in Figure 5.21. As we can see, P2 starts execution first
and completes at time 35. At this point, P1 starts; it completes its CPU burst at
time 55. However, the first deadline for P1 was at time 50, so the scheduler has
caused P1 to miss its deadline.
Now suppose we use rate-monotonic scheduling, in which we assign P1
a higher priority than P2 because the period of P1 is shorter than that of P2.
The execution of these processes in this situation is shown in Figure 5.22. P1
starts first and completes its CPU burst at time 20, thereby meeting its first
deadline. P2 starts running at this point and runs until time 50. At this time, it is
preempted by P1, although it still has 5 milliseconds remaining in its CPU burst.
P1 completes its CPU burst at time 70, at which point the scheduler resumes P2.
P2 completes its CPU burst at time 75, also meeting its first deadline. The system
is idle until time 100, when P1 is scheduled again.
Rate-monotonic scheduling is considered optimal in that if a set of pro-
cesses cannot be scheduled by this algorithm, it cannot be scheduled by any
other algorithm that assigns static priorities. Let’s next examine a set of pro-
cesses that cannot be scheduled using the rate-monotonic algorithm.
Assume that process P1 has a period of p1 = 50 and a CPU burst of t1 = 25.
For P2, the corresponding values are p2 = 80 and t2 = 35. Rate-monotonic

scheduling would assign process P1 a higher priority, as it has the shorter
period. The total CPU utilization of the two processes is (25∕50) + (35∕80) =
0.94, and it therefore seems logical that the two processes could be scheduled
and still leave the CPU with 6 percent available time. Figure 5.23 shows the
scheduling of processes P1 and P2. Initially, P1 runs until it completes its CPU
burst at time 25. Process P2 then begins running and runs until time 50, when
it is preempted by P1. At this point, P2 still has 10 milliseconds remaining in its
CPU burst. Process P1 runs until time 75; consequently, P2 finishes its burst at
time 85, after the deadline for completion of its CPU burst at time 80.
Despite being optimal, then, rate-monotonic scheduling has a limitation:
CPU utilization is bounded, and it is not always possible to maximize CPU
resources fully. The worst-case CPU utilization for scheduling N processes is
N(21∕N −1).
With one process in the system, CPU utilization is 100 percent, but it falls to
approximately 69 percent as the number of processes approaches infinity. With
two processes, CPU utilization is bounded at about 83 percent. Combined CPU
utilization for the two processes scheduled in Figure 5.21 and Figure 5.22 is
75 percent; therefore, the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm is guaranteed
to schedule them so that they can meet their deadlines. For the two processes
scheduled in Figure 5.23, combined CPU utilization is approximately 94 per-
cent; therefore, rate-monotonic scheduling cannot guarantee that they can be
scheduled so that they meet their deadlines.
Earliest-Deadline-First Scheduling
Earliest-deadline-firs (EDF) scheduling assigns priorities dynamically accord-
ing to deadline. The earlier the deadline, the higher the priority; the later the
deadline, the lower the priority. Under the EDF policy, when a process becomes
runnable, it must announce its deadline requirements to the system. Priorities
may have to be adjusted to reflect the deadline of the newly runnable process.
Note how this differs from rate-monotonic scheduling, where priorities are
fixed.
To illustrate EDF scheduling, we again schedule the processes shown in
Figure 5.23, which failed to meet deadline requirements under rate-monotonic
scheduling. Recall that P1 has values of p1 = 50 and t1 = 25 and that P2 has
values of p2 = 80 and t2 = 35. The EDF scheduling of these processes is shown
in Figure 5.24. Process P1 has the earliest deadline, so its initial priority is higher
than that of process P2. Process P2 begins running at the end of the CPU burst
for P1. However, whereas rate-monotonic scheduling allows P1 to preempt P2

at the beginning of its next period at time 50, EDF scheduling allows process
P2 to continue running. P2 now has a higher priority than P1 because its next
deadline (at time 80) is earlier than that of P1 (at time 100). Thus, both P1 and
P2 meet their first deadlines. Process P1 again begins running at time 60 and
completes its second CPU burst at time 85, also meeting its second deadline at
time 100. P2 begins running at this point, only to be preempted by P1 at the
start of its next period at time 100. P2 is preempted because P1 has an earlier
deadline (time 150) than P2 (time 160). At time 125, P1 completes its CPU burst
and P2 resumes execution, finishing at time 145 and meeting its deadline as
well. The system is idle until time 150, when P1 is scheduled to run once again.
Unlike the rate-monotonic algorithm, EDF scheduling does not require that
processes be periodic, nor must a process require a constant amount of CPU
time per burst. The only requirement is that a process announce its deadline
to the scheduler when it becomes runnable. The appeal of EDF scheduling is
that it is theoretically optimal—theoretically, it can schedule processes so that
each process can meet its deadline requirements and CPU utilization will be
100 percent. In practice, however, it is impossible to achieve this level of CPU
utilization due to the cost of context switching between processes and interrupt
handling.
Proportional Share Scheduling
Proportional share schedulers operate by allocating T shares among all appli-
cations. An application can receive N shares of time, thus ensuring that the
application will have N∕T of the total processor time. As an example, assume
that a total of T = 100 shares is to be divided among three processes, A, B, and
C. A is assigned 50 shares, B is assigned 15 shares, and C is assigned 20 shares.
This scheme ensures that A will have 50 percent of total processor time, B will
have 15 percent, and C will have 20 percent.
Proportional share schedulers must work in conjunction with an
admission-control policy to guarantee that an application receives its allocated
shares of time. An admission-control policy will admit a client requesting
a particular number of shares only if sufficient shares are available. In our
current example, we have allocated 50 + 15 + 20 = 85 shares of the total of
100 shares. If a new process D requested 30 shares, the admission controller
would deny D entry into the system.
POSIX Real-Time Scheduling
The POSIX standard also provides extensions for real-time computing—
POSIX.1b. Here, we cover some of the POSIX API related to scheduling real-time
threads. POSIX defines two scheduling classes for real-time threads:
CPU Scheduling
• SCHED FIFO
• SCHED RR
SCHED FIFO schedules threads according to a first-come, first-served policy
using a FIFO queue as outlined in Section 5.3.1. However, there is no time slic-
ing among threads of equal priority. Therefore, the highest-priority real-time
thread at the front of the FIFO queue will be granted the CPU until it termi-
nates or blocks. SCHED RR uses a round-robin policy. It is similar to SCHED FIFO
except that it provides time slicing among threads of equal priority. POSIX
provides an additional scheduling class—SCHED OTHER—but its implemen-
tation is undefined and system specific; it may behave differently on different
systems.
The POSIX API specifies the following two functions for getting and setting
the scheduling policy:
• pthread attr getschedpolicy(pthread attr t *attr, int
*policy)
• pthread attr setschedpolicy(pthread attr t *attr, int
policy)
The first parameter to both functions is a pointer to the set of attributes for
the thread. The second parameter is either (1) a pointer to an integer that is
set to the current scheduling policy (for pthread attr getsched policy())
or (2) an integer value (SCHED FIFO, SCHED RR, or SCHED OTHER) for the
pthread attr setsched policy() function. Both functions return nonzero
values if an error occurs.
In Figure 5.25, we illustrate a POSIX Pthread program using this API. This
program first determines the current scheduling policy and then sets the
scheduling algorithm to SCHED FIFO.


## 5.7 Operating-System Examples
> id: ch05-5-7 | src: book 5.7 | kind: concept

We turn next to a description of the scheduling policies of the Linux, Win-
dows, and Solaris operating systems. It is important to note that we use the
term process scheduling in a general sense here. In fact, we are describing the
scheduling of kernel threads with Solaris and Windows systems and of tasks
with the Linux scheduler.
Example: Linux Scheduling
Process scheduling in Linux has had an interesting history. Prior to Version 2.5,
the Linux kernel ran a variation of the traditional UNIX scheduling algorithm.
However, as this algorithm was not designed with SMP systems in mind, it
did not adequately support systems with multiple processors. In addition, it
resulted in poor performance for systems with a large number of runnable pro-
cesses. With Version 2.5 of the kernel, the scheduler was overhauled to include
a scheduling algorithm—known as O(1)—that ran in constant time regard-
less of the number of tasks in the system. The O(1) scheduler also provided

CPU Scheduling
increased support for SMP systems, including processor affinity and load bal-
ancing between processors. However, in practice, although the O(1) scheduler
delivered excellent performance on SMP systems, it led to poor response times
for the interactive processes that are common on many desktop computer sys-
tems. During development of the 2.6 kernel, the scheduler was again revised;
and in release 2.6.23 of the kernel, the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) became
the default Linux scheduling algorithm.
Scheduling in the Linux system is based on scheduling classes. Each class
is assigned a specific priority. By using different scheduling classes, the kernel
can accommodate different scheduling algorithms based on the needs of the
system and its processes. The scheduling criteria for a Linux server, for exam-
ple, may be different from those for a mobile device running Linux. To decide
which task to run next, the scheduler selects the highest-priority task belong-
ing to the highest-priority scheduling class. Standard Linux kernels implement
two scheduling classes: (1) a default scheduling class using the CFS scheduling
algorithm and (2) a real-time scheduling class. We discuss each of these classes
here. New scheduling classes can, of course, be added.
Rather than using strict rules that associate a relative priority value with
the length of a time quantum, the CFS scheduler assigns a proportion of CPU
processing time to each task. This proportion is calculated based on the nice
value assigned to each task. Nice values range from −20 to +19, where a
numerically lower nice value indicates a higher relative priority. Tasks with
lower nice values receive a higher proportion of CPU processing time than tasks
with higher nice values. The default nice value is 0. (The term nice comes from
the idea that if a task increases its nice value from, say, 0 to +10, it is being nice
to other tasks in the system by lowering its relative priority. In other words, nice
processes finish last!) CFS doesn’t use discrete values of time slices and instead
identifies a targeted latency, which is an interval of time during which every
runnable task should run at least once. Proportions of CPU time are allocated
from the value of targeted latency. In addition to having default and minimum
values, targeted latency can increase if the number of active tasks in the system
grows beyond a certain threshold.
The CFS scheduler doesn’t directly assign priorities. Rather, it records how
long each task has run by maintaining the virtual run time of each task using
the per-task variable vruntime. The virtual run time is associated with a decay
factor based on the priority of a task: lower-priority tasks have higher rates
of decay than higher-priority tasks. For tasks at normal priority (nice values
of 0), virtual run time is identical to actual physical run time. Thus, if a task
with default priority runs for 200 milliseconds, its vruntime will also be 200
milliseconds. However, if a lower-priority task runs for 200 milliseconds, its
vruntime will be higher than 200 milliseconds. Similarly, if a higher-priority
task runs for 200 milliseconds, its vruntime will be less than 200 milliseconds.
To decide which task to run next, the scheduler simply selects the task that has
the smallest vruntime value. In addition, a higher-priority task that becomes
available to run can preempt a lower-priority task.
Let’s examine the CFS scheduler in action: Assume that two tasks have
the same nice values. One task is I/O-bound, and the other is CPU-bound.
Typically, the I/O-bound task will run only for short periods before blocking for
additional I/O, and the CPU-bound task will exhaust its time period whenever it
has an opportunity to run on a processor. Therefore, the value of vruntime will

CFS PERFORMANCE
The Linux CFS scheduler provides an efficient algorithm for selecting which
task to run next. Rather than using a standard queue data structure, each
runnable task is placed in a red-black tree—a balanced binary search tree
whose key is based on the value of vruntime. This tree is shown below.

value of vruntime
value of vruntime
When a task becomes runnable, it is added to the tree. If a task on the
tree is not runnable (for example, if it is blocked while waiting for I/O), it is
removed. Generally speaking, tasks that have been given less processing time
(smaller values of vruntime) are toward the left side of the tree, and tasks
that have been given more processing time are on the right side. According
to the properties of a binary search tree, the leftmost node has the smallest
key value, which for the sake of the CFS scheduler means that it is the task
with the highest priority. Because the red-black tree is balanced, navigating
it to discover the leftmost node will require O(log N) operations (where N
is the number of nodes in the tree). However, for efficiency reasons, the
Linux scheduler caches this value in the variable rb leftmost, and thus
determining which task to run next requires only retrieving the cached value.
eventually be lower for the I/O-bound task than for the CPU-bound task, giving
the I/O-bound task higher priority than the CPU-bound task. At that point, if
the CPU-bound task is executing when the I/O-bound task becomes eligible
to run (for example, when I/O the task is waiting for becomes available), the
I/O-bound task will preempt the CPU-bound task.
Linux also implements real-time scheduling using the POSIX standard as
described in Section 5.6.6. Any task scheduled using either the SCHED FIFO or
the SCHED RR real-time policy runs at a higher priority than normal (non-real-
time) tasks. Linux uses two separate priority ranges, one for real-time tasks and
a second for normal tasks. Real-time tasks are assigned static priorities within
the range of 0 to 99, and normal tasks are assigned priorities from 100 to 139.
These two ranges map into a global priority scheme wherein numerically lower
values indicate higher relative priorities. Normal tasks are assigned a priority

based on their nice values, where a value of −20 maps to priority 100 and a nice
value of +19 maps to 139. This scheme is shown in Figure 5.26.
The CFS scheduler also supports load balancing, using a sophisticated
technique that equalizes the load among processing cores yet is also NUMA-
aware and minimizes the migration of threads. CFS defines the load of each
thread as a combination of the thread’s priority and its average rate of CPU
utilization. Therefore, a thread that has a high priority, yet is mostly I/O-bound
and requires little CPU usage, has a generally low load, similar to the load of
a low-priority thread that has high CPU utilization. Using this metric, the load
of a queue is the sum of the loads of all threads in the queue, and balancing is
simply ensuring that all queues have approximately the same load.
As highlighted in Section 5.5.4, however, migrating a thread may result
in a memory access penalty due to either having to invalidate cache con-
tents or, on NUMA systems, incurring longer memory access times. To address
this problem, Linux identifies a hierarchical system of scheduling domains.
A scheduling domain is a set of CPU cores that can be balanced against one
another. This idea is illustrated in Figure 5.27. The cores in each scheduling
domain are grouped according to how they share the resources of the system.
For example, although each core shown in Figure 5.27 may have its own level
1 (L1) cache, pairs of cores share a level 2 (L2) cache and are thus organized
into separate domain0 and domain1. Likewise, these two domains may share a
level 3 (L3) cache, and are therefore organized into a processor-level domain
(also known as a NUMA node). Taking this one-step further, on a NUMAsystem,

a larger system-level domain would combine separate processor-level NUMA
nodes.
The general strategy behind CFS is to balance loads within domains, begin-
ning at the lowest level of the hierarchy. Using Figure 5.27 as an example,
initially a thread would only migrate between cores on the same domain
(i.e. within domain0 or domain1.) Load balancing at the next level would occur
between domain0 and domain1. CFS is reluctant to migrate threads between sep-
arate NUMA nodes if a thread would be moved farther from its local memory,
and such migration would only occur under severe load imbalances. As a
general rule, if the overall system is busy, CFS will not load-balance beyond
the domain local to each core to avoid the memory latency penalties of NUMA
systems.
Example: Windows Scheduling
Windows schedules threads using a priority-based, preemptive scheduling
algorithm. The Windows scheduler ensures that the highest-priority thread
will always run. The portion of the Windows kernel that handles scheduling
is called the dispatcher. A thread selected to run by the dispatcher will run
until it is preempted by a higher-priority thread, until it terminates, until its
time quantum ends, or until it calls a blocking system call, such as for I/O. If a
higher-priority real-time thread becomes ready while a lower-priority thread
is running, the lower-priority thread will be preempted. This preemption gives
a real-time thread preferential access to the CPU when the thread needs such
access.
The dispatcher uses a 32-level priority scheme to determine the order of
thread execution. Priorities are divided into two classes. The variable class
contains threads having priorities from 1 to 15, and the real-time class contains
threads with priorities ranging from 16 to 31. (There is also a thread running at
priority 0 that is used for memory management.) The dispatcher uses a queue
for each scheduling priority and traverses the set of queues from highest to
lowest until it finds a thread that is ready to run. If no ready thread is found,
the dispatcher will execute a special thread called the idle thread.
There is a relationship between the numeric priorities of the Windows
kernel and the Windows API. The Windows API identifies the following six
priority classes to which a process can belong:
• IDLE PRIORITY CLASS
• BELOW NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS
• NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS
• ABOVE NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS
• HIGH PRIORITY CLASS
• REALTIME PRIORITY CLASS
Processes are typically members of the NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS. A process
belongs to this class unless the parent of the process was a member of the
IDLE PRIORITY CLASS or unless another class was specified when the process
was created. Additionally, the priority class of a process can be altered with
CPU Scheduling
the SetPriorityClass() function in the Windows API. Priorities in all classes
except the REALTIME PRIORITY CLASS are variable, meaning that the priority of
a thread belonging to one of these classes can change.
Athread within a given priority class also has a relative priority. The values
for relative priorities include:
• IDLE
• LOWEST
• BELOW NORMAL
• NORMAL
• ABOVE NORMAL
• HIGHEST
• TIME CRITICAL
The priority of each thread is based on both the priority class it belongs
to and its relative priority within that class. This relationship is shown in
Figure 5.28. The values of the priority classes appear in the top row. The
left column contains the values for the relative priorities. For example, if the
relative priority of a thread in the ABOVE NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS is NORMAL,
the numeric priority of that thread is 10.
Furthermore, each thread has a base priority representing a value in the
priority range for the class to which the thread belongs. By default, the base
priority is the value of the NORMAL relative priority for that class. The base
priorities for each priority class are as follows:
• REALTIME PRIORITY CLASS—24
• HIGH PRIORITY CLASS—13
• ABOVE NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS—10
• NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS—8

• BELOW NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS—6
• IDLE PRIORITY CLASS—4
The initial priority of a thread is typically the base priority of the process
the thread belongs to, although the SetThreadPriority() function in the
Windows API can also be used to modify a thread’s base priority.
When a thread’s time quantum runs out, that thread is interrupted. If the
thread is in the variable-priority class, its priority is lowered. The priority is
never lowered below the base priority, however. Lowering the priority tends
to limit the CPU consumption of compute-bound threads. When a variable-
priority thread is released from a wait operation, the dispatcher boosts the
priority. The amount of the boost depends on what the thread was waiting for.
For example, a thread waiting for keyboard I/O would get a large increase,
whereas a thread waiting for a disk operation would get a moderate one.
This strategy tends to give good response times to interactive threads that are
using the mouse and windows. It also enables I/O-bound threads to keep the
I/O devices busy while permitting compute-bound threads to use spare CPU
cycles in the background. This strategy is used by several operating systems,
including UNIX. In addition, the window with which the user is currently
interacting receives a priority boost to enhance its response time.
When a user is running an interactive program, the system needs to pro-
vide especially good performance. For this reason, Windows has a special
scheduling rule for processes in the NORMAL PRIORITY CLASS. Windows distin-
guishes between the foreground process that is currently selected on the screen
and the background processes that are not currently selected. When a process
moves into the foreground, Windows increases the scheduling quantum by
some factor—typically by 3. This increase gives the foreground process three
times longer to run before a time-sharing preemption occurs.
Windows 7 introduced user-mode scheduling (UMS), which allows appli-
cations to create and manage threads independently of the kernel. Thus, an
application can create and schedule multiple threads without involving the
Windows kernel scheduler. For applications that create a large number of
threads, scheduling threads in user mode is much more efficient than kernel-
mode thread scheduling, as no kernel intervention is necessary.
Earlier versions of Windows provided a similar feature known as fiber ,
which allowed several user-mode threads (fibers) to be mapped to a single
kernel thread. However, fibers were of limited practical use. Afiber was unable
to make calls to the Windows API because all fibers had to share the thread
environment block (TEB) of the thread on which they were running. This pre-
sented a problem if a Windows API function placed state information into the
TEB for one fiber, only to have the information overwritten by a different fiber.
UMS overcomes this obstacle by providing each user-mode thread with its own
thread context.
In addition, unlike fibers, UMS is not intended to be used directly by the
programmer. The details of writing user-mode schedulers can be very chal-
lenging, and UMS does not include such a scheduler. Rather, the schedulers
come from programming language libraries that build on top of UMS. For
example, Microsoft provides Concurrency Runtime (ConcRT), a concurrent
programming framework for C++ that is designed for task-based parallelism
CPU Scheduling
(Section 4.2) on multicore processors. ConcRT provides a user-mode scheduler
together with facilities for decomposing programs into tasks, which can then
be scheduled on the available processing cores.
Windows
also
supports scheduling on
multiprocessor systems as
described in Section 5.5 by attempting to schedule a thread on the most
optimal processing core for that thread, which includes maintaining a thread’s
preferred as well as most recent processor. One technique used by Windows is
to create sets of logical processors (known as SMT sets). On a hyper-threaded
SMT system, hardware threads belonging to the same CPU core would also
belong to the same SMT set. Logical processors are numbered, beginning from
0. As an example, a dual-threaded/quad-core system would contain eight
logical processors, consisting of the four SMT sets: {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}, and {6,
scheduler attempts to maintain a thread running on logical processors within
the same SMT set.
To distribute loads across different logical processors, each thread is
assigned an ideal processor, which is a number representing a thread’s
preferred processor. Each process has an initial seed value identifying the
ideal CPU for a thread belonging to that process. This seed is incremented for
each new thread created by that process, thereby distributing the load across
different logical processors. On SMT systems, the increment for the next ideal
processor is in the next SMT set. For example, on a dual-threaded/quad-core
system, the ideal processors for threads in a specific process would be assigned
0, 2, 4, 6, 0, 2, .... To avoid the situation wherby the first thread for each process
is assigned processor 0, processes are assigned different seed values, thereby
distributing the load of threads across all physical processing cores in the
system. Continuing our example from above, if the seed for a second process
were 1, the ideal processors would be assigned in the order 1, 3, 5, 7, 1, 3, and
so forth.
Example: Solaris Scheduling
Solaris uses priority-based thread scheduling. Each thread belongs to one of
six classes:
1. Time sharing (TS)
2. Interactive (IA)
3. Real time (RT)
4. System (SYS)
5. Fair share (FSS)
6. Fixed priority (FP)
Within each class there are different priorities and different scheduling algo-
rithms.
The default scheduling class for a process is time sharing. The scheduling
policy for the time-sharing class dynamically alters priorities and assigns time
slices of different lengths using a multilevel feedback queue. By default, there
is an inverse relationship between priorities and time slices. The higher the

priority, the smaller the time slice; and the lower the priority, the larger the
time slice. Interactive processes typically have a higher priority; CPU-bound
processes, a lower priority. This scheduling policy gives good response time
for interactive processes and good throughput for CPU-bound processes. The
interactive class uses the same scheduling policy as the time-sharing class, but
it gives windowing applications—such as those created by the KDE or GNOME
window managers—a higher priority for better performance.
Figure 5.29 shows the simplified dispatch table for scheduling time-sharing
and interactive threads. These two scheduling classes include 60 priority levels,
but for brevity, we display only a handful. (To see the full dispatch table on a
Solaris system or VM, run dispadmin -c TS -g.) The dispatch table shown in
Figure 5.29 contains the following fields:
• Priority. The class-dependent priority for the time-sharing and interactive
classes. A higher number indicates a higher priority.
• Time quantum. The time quantum for the associated priority. This illus-
trates the inverse relationship between priorities and time quanta: the
lowest priority (priority 0) has the highest time quantum (200 millisec-
onds), and the highest priority (priority 59) has the lowest time quantum
(20 milliseconds).
• Time quantum expired. The new priority of a thread that has used its
entire time quantum without blocking. Such threads are considered CPU-
intensive. As shown in the table, these threads have their priorities low-
ered.
CPU Scheduling
• Return from sleep. The priority of a thread that is returning from sleeping
(such as from waiting for I/O). As the table illustrates, when I/O is available
for a waiting thread, its priority is boosted to between 50 and 59, support-
ing the scheduling policy of providing good response time for interactive
processes.
Threads in the real-time class are given the highest priority. A real-time
process will run before a process in any other class. This assignment allows
a real-time process to have a guaranteed response from the system within
a bounded period of time. In general, however, few processes belong to the
real-time class.
Solaris uses the system class to run kernel threads, such as the scheduler
and paging daemon. Once the priority of a system thread is established, it does
not change. The system class is reserved for kernel use (user processes running
in kernel mode are not in the system class).
The fixed-priority and fair-share classes were introduced with Solaris 9.
Threads in the fixed-priority class have the same priority range as those in
the time-sharing class; however, their priorities are not dynamically adjusted.
The fair-share class uses CPU shares instead of priorities to make scheduling
decisions. CPU shares indicate entitlement to available CPU resources and are
allocated to a set of processes (known as a project).
Each scheduling class includes a set of priorities. However, the scheduler
converts the class-specific priorities into global priorities and selects the thread
with the highest global priority to run. The selected thread runs on the CPU
until it (1) blocks, (2) uses its time slice, or (3) is preempted by a higher-priority
thread. If there are multiple threads with the same priority, the scheduler uses
a round-robin queue. Figure 5.30 illustrates how the six scheduling classes
relate to one another and how they map to global priorities. Notice that the
kernel maintains ten threads for servicing interrupts. These threads do not
belong to any scheduling class and execute at the highest priority (160–169).
As mentioned, Solaris has traditionally used the many-to-many model (Section
4.3.3) but switched to the one-to-one model (Section 4.3.2) beginning with
Solaris 9.

How do we select a CPU-scheduling algorithm for a particular system? As we
saw in Section 5.3, there are many scheduling algorithms, each with its own
parameters. As a result, selecting an algorithm can be difficult.
The first problem is defining the criteria to be used in selecting an algo-
rithm. As we saw in Section 5.2, criteria are often defined in terms of CPU
utilization, response time, or throughput. To select an algorithm, we must
first define the relative importance of these elements. Our criteria may include
several measures, such as these:
• Maximizing CPU utilization under the constraint that the maximum
response time is 300 milliseconds

**Queueing Models**

- Describes the arrival of processes, and CPU and I/O bursts probabilistically
  - Commonly exponential, and described by mean

**Little’s Formula**

- n = average queue length
- W = average waiting time in queue
- λ = average arrival rate into queue
- Little’s law – in steady state, processes leaving queue must equal processes arriving, thus:      n = λ x W

• Maximizing throughput such that turnaround time is (on average) linearly
proportional to total execution time
Once the selection criteria have been defined, we want to evaluate the algo-
rithms under consideration. We next describe the various evaluation methods
we can use.
Deterministic Modeling
One major class of evaluation methods is analytic evaluation. Analytic evalu-
ation uses the given algorithm and the system workload to produce a formula
or number to evaluate the performance of the algorithm for that workload.
Deterministic modeling is one type of analytic evaluation. This method
takes a particular predetermined workload and defines the performance of
each algorithm for that workload. For example, assume that we have the
workload shown below. All five processes arrive at time 0, in the order given,
with the length of the CPU burst given in milliseconds:
CPU Scheduling
Process
Burst Time
P1
P2
P3
P4
P5
Consider the FCFS, SJF, and RR (quantum = 10 milliseconds) scheduling algo-
rithms for this set of processes. Which algorithm would give the minimum
average waiting time?
For the FCFS algorithm, we would execute the processes as
P2
P5
P3
P4
P1
The waiting time is 0 milliseconds for process P1, 10 milliseconds for process
P2, 39 milliseconds for process P3, 42 milliseconds for process P4, and 49
milliseconds for process P5. Thus, the average waiting time is (0 + 10 + 39 +
42 + 49)/5 = 28 milliseconds.
With nonpreemptive SJF scheduling, we execute the processes as
P5
P2
P3
P4
P1
The waiting time is 10 milliseconds for process P1, 32 milliseconds for process
P2, 0 milliseconds for process P3, 3 milliseconds for process P4, and 20 millisec-
onds for process P5. Thus, the average waiting time is (10 + 32 + 0 + 3 + 20)/5
= 13 milliseconds.
With the RR algorithm, we execute the processes as
P5
P5
P2
P2
P2
P3
P4
50 52
P1
The waiting time is 0 milliseconds for process P1, 32 milliseconds for process
P2, 20 milliseconds for process P3, 23 milliseconds for process P4, and 40
milliseconds for process P5. Thus, the average waiting time is (0 + 32 + 20 +
23 + 40)/5 = 23 milliseconds.
We can see that, in this case, the average waiting time obtained with the SJF
policy is less than half that obtained with FCFS scheduling; the RR algorithm
gives us an intermediate value.
Deterministic modeling is simple and fast. It gives us exact numbers, allow-
ing us to compare the algorithms. However, it requires exact numbers for input,
and its answers apply only to those cases. The main uses of deterministic
modeling are in describing scheduling algorithms and providing examples.
In cases where we are running the same program over and over again and can


## 5.8 Algorithm Evaluation
> id: ch05-5-8 | src: book 5.8 | kind: concept

measure the program’s processing requirements exactly, we may be able to use
deterministic modeling to select a scheduling algorithm. Furthermore, over a
set of examples, deterministic modeling may indicate trends that can then be
analyzed and proved separately. For example, it can be shown that, for the
environment described (all processes and their times available at time 0), the
SJF policy will always result in the minimum waiting time.
Queueing Models
On many systems, the processes that are run vary from day to day, so there is
no static set of processes (or times) to use for deterministic modeling. What can
be determined, however, is the distribution of CPU and I/O bursts. These dis-
tributions can be measured and then approximated or simply estimated. The
result is a mathematical formula describing the probability of a particular CPU
burst. Commonly, this distribution is exponential and is described by its mean.
Similarly, we can describe the distribution of times when processes arrive in
the system (the arrival-time distribution). From these two distributions, it is
possible to compute the average throughput, utilization, waiting time, and so
on for most algorithms.
The computer system is described as a network of servers. Each server has
a queue of waiting processes. The CPU is a server with its ready queue, as is the
I/O system with its device queues. Knowing arrival rates and service rates, we
can compute utilization, average queue length, average wait time, and so on.
This area of study is called queueing-network analysis.
As an example, let n be the average long-term queue length (excluding the
process being serviced), let W be the average waiting time in the queue, and
let λ be the average arrival rate for new processes in the queue (such as three
processes per second). We expect that during the time W that a process waits,
λ × W new processes will arrive in the queue. If the system is in a steady state,
then the number of processes leaving the queue must be equal to the number
of processes that arrive. Thus,
n = λ × W.
This equation, known as Little’s formula, is particularly useful because it is
valid for any scheduling algorithm and arrival distribution. For example n
could be the number of customers in a store.
We can use Little’s formula to compute one of the three variables if we
know the other two. For example, if we know that 7 processes arrive every
second (on average) and that there are normally 14 processes in the queue,
then we can compute the average waiting time per process as 2 seconds.
Queueing analysis can be useful in comparing scheduling algorithms, but
it also has limitations. At the moment, the classes of algorithms and distribu-
tions that can be handled are fairly limited. The mathematics of complicated
algorithms and distributions can be difficult to work with. Thus, arrival and
service distributions are often defined in mathematically tractable—but unre-
alistic—ways. It is also generally necessary to make a number of indepen-
dent assumptions, which may not be accurate. As a result of these difficulties,
queueing models are often only approximations of real systems, and the accu-
racy of the computed results may be questionable.
CPU Scheduling
Simulations
To get a more accurate evaluation of scheduling algorithms, we can use simu-
lations. Running simulations involves programming a model of the computer
system. Software data structures represent the major components of the sys-
tem. The simulator has a variable representing a clock. As this variable’s value
is increased, the simulator modifies the system state to reflect the activities
of the devices, the processes, and the scheduler. As the simulation executes,
statistics that indicate algorithm performance are gathered and printed.
The data to drive the simulation can be generated in several ways. The most
common method uses a random-number generator that is programmed to
generate processes, CPU burst times, arrivals, departures, and so on, according
to probability distributions. The distributions can be defined mathematically
(uniform, exponential, Poisson) or empirically. If a distribution is to be defined
empirically, measurements of the actual system under study are taken. The
results define the distribution of events in the real system; this distribution can
then be used to drive the simulation.
A distribution-driven simulation may be inaccurate, however, because of
relationships between successive events in the real system. The frequency
distribution indicates only how many instances of each event occur; it does not
indicate anything about the order of their occurrence. To correct this problem,
we can use trace files. We create a trace by monitoring the real system and
recording the sequence of actual events (Figure 5.31). We then use this sequence
to drive the simulation. Trace files provide an excellent way to compare two
algorithms on exactly the same set of real inputs. This method can produce
accurate results for its inputs.
Simulations can be expensive, often requiring many hours of computer
time. A more detailed simulation provides more accurate results, but it also

takes more computer time. In addition, trace files can require large amounts of
storage space. Finally, the design, coding, and debugging of the simulator can
be a major task.
Implementation
Even a simulation is of limited accuracy. The only completely accurate way
to evaluate a scheduling algorithm is to code it up, put it in the operating
system, and see how it works. This approach puts the actual algorithm in the
real system for evaluation under real operating conditions.
This method is not without expense. The expense is incurred in coding the
algorithm and modifying the operating system to support it (along with its
required data structures). There is also cost in testing the changes, usually in
virtual machines rather than on dedicated hardware. Regression testing con-
firms that the changes haven’t made anything worse, and haven’t caused new
bugs or caused old bugs to be recreated (for example because the algorithm
being replaced solved some bug and changing it caused that bug to reoccur).
Another difficulty is that the environment in which the algorithm is used
will change. The environment will change not only in the usual way, as new
programs are written and the types of problems change, but also as a result
of the performance of the scheduler. If short processes are given priority, then
users may break larger processes into sets of smaller processes. If interactive
processes are given priority over noninteractive processes, then users may
switch to interactive use. This problem is usually addressed by using tools or
scripts that encapsulate complete sets of actions, repeatedly using those tools,
and using those tools while measuring the results (and detecting any problems
they cause in the new environment).
Of course human or program behavior can attempt to circumvent schedul-
ing algorithms. For example, researchers designed one system that classi-
fied interactive and noninteractive processes automatically by looking at the
amount of terminal I/O. If a process did not input or output to the terminal
in a 1-second interval, the process was classified as noninteractive and was
moved to a lower-priority queue. In response to this policy, one programmer
modified his programs to write an arbitrary character to the terminal at regular
intervals of less than 1 second. The system gave his programs a high priority,
even though the terminal output was completely meaningless.
In general, most flexible scheduling algorithms are those that can be altered
by the system managers or by the users so that they can be tuned for a spe-
cific application or set of applications. A workstation that performs high-end
graphical applications, for instance, may have scheduling needs different from
those of a web server or file server. Some operating systems—particularly sev-
eral versions of UNIX—allow the system manager to fine-tune the scheduling
parameters for a particular system configuration. For example, Solaris pro-
vides the dispadmin command to allow the system administrator to modify
the parameters of the scheduling classes described in Section 5.7.3.
Another approach is to use APIs that can modify the priority of a process
or thread. The Java, POSIX, and Windows APIs provide such functions. The
downfall of this approach is that performance-tuning a system or application
most often does not result in improved performance in more general situations.
CPU Scheduling


## 5.9 Summary
> id: ch05-5-9 | src: book 5.9 | kind: concept

• CPU scheduling is the task of selecting a waiting process from the ready
queue and allocating the CPU to it. The CPU is allocated to the selected
process by the dispatcher.
• Scheduling algorithms may be either preemptive (where the CPU can be
taken away from a process) or nonpreemptive (where a process must
voluntarily relinquish control of the CPU). Almost all modern operating
systems are preemptive.
• Scheduling algorithms can be evaluated according to the following five
criteria: (1) CPU utilization, (2) throughput, (3) turnaround time, (4) waiting
time, and (5) response time.
• First-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling is the simplest scheduling algo-
rithm, but it can cause short processes to wait for very long processes.
• Shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling is provably optimal, providing the short-
est average waiting time. Implementing SJF scheduling is difficult, how-
ever, because predicting the length of the next CPU burst is difficult.
• Round-robin (RR) scheduling allocates the CPU to each process for a time
quantum. If the process does not relinquish the CPU before its time quan-
tum expires, the process is preempted, and another process is scheduled
to run for a time quantum.
• Priority scheduling assigns each process a priority, and the CPU is allocated
to the process with the highest priority. Processes with the same priority
can be scheduled in FCFS order or using RR scheduling.
• Multilevel queue scheduling partitions processes into several separate
queues arranged by priority, and the scheduler executes the processes in
the highest-priority queue. Different scheduling algorithms may be used
in each queue.
• Multilevel feedback queues are similar to multilevel queues, except that a
process may migrate between different queues.
• Multicore processors place one or more CPUs on the same physical chip,
and each CPU may have more than one hardware thread. From the per-
spective of the operating system, each hardware thread appears to be a
logical CPU.
• Load balancing on multicore systems equalizes loads between CPU cores,
although migrating threads between cores to balance loads may invalidate
cache contents and therefore may increase memory access times.
• Soft real-time scheduling gives priority to real-time tasks over non-real-
time tasks. Hard real-time scheduling provides timing guarantees for real-
time tasks,
• Rate-monotonic real-time scheduling schedules periodic tasks using a
static priority policy with preemption.


## Practice Exercises
> id: ch05-practice-exercises | src: book Practice Exercises | kind: concept

• Earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling assigns priorities according to
deadline. The earlier the deadline, the higher the priority; the later the
deadline, the lower the priority.
• Proportional share scheduling allocates T shares among all applications. If
an application is allocated N shares of time, it is ensured of having N∕T of
the total processor time.
• Linux uses the completely fair scheduler (CFS), which assigns a proportion
of CPU processing time to each task. The proportion is based on the virtual
runtime (vruntime) value associated with each task.
• Windows scheduling uses a preemptive, 32-level priority scheme to deter-
mine the order of thread scheduling.
• Solaris identifies six unique scheduling classes that are mapped to a global
priority. CPU-intensive threads are generally assigned lower priorities
(and longer time quantums), and I/O-bound threads are usually assigned
higher priorities (with shorter time quantums.)
• Modeling and simulations can be used to evaluate a CPU scheduling algo-
rithm.

the scheduling algorithms for each queue, the criteria used to move
processes between queues, and so on.

of RR algorithms for all time slices, and so on). One set of algorithms may

> id: ch05-5-9 | src: book 5.9 | kind: concept

The traditional UNIX scheduler enforces an inverse relationship between
priority numbers and priorities: the higher the number, the lower the
priority. The scheduler recalculates process priorities once per second
using the following function:
Priority = (recent CPU usage / 2) + base
where base = 60 and recent CPU usage refers to a value indicating how
often a process has used the CPU since priorities were last recalculated.
Assume that recent CPU usage for process P1 is 40, for process P2 is 18,
and for process P3 is 10. What will be the new priorities for these three
processes when priorities are recalculated? Based on this information,
does the traditional UNIX scheduler raise or lower the relative priority
of a CPU-bound process?

One technique for implementing lottery scheduling works by assigning
processes lottery tickets, which are used for allocating CPU time. When-
ever a scheduling decision has to be made, a lottery ticket is chosen at
random, and the process holding that ticket gets the CPU. The BTV oper-
ating system implements lottery scheduling by holding a lottery 50 times
each second, with each lottery winner getting 20 milliseconds of CPU
time (20 milliseconds × 50 = 1 second). Describe how the BTV scheduler
can ensure that higher-priority threads receive more attention from the
CPU than lower-priority threads.
Most scheduling algorithms maintain a run queue, which lists processes
eligible to run on a processor. On multicore systems, there are two

(2) a single run queue is shared by all processing cores. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches?

A variation of the round-robin scheduler is the regressive round-robin
scheduler. This scheduler assigns each process a time quantum and a
priority. The initial value of a time quantum is 50 milliseconds. However,
every time a process has been allocated the CPU and uses its entire time
quantum (does not block for I/O), 10 milliseconds is added to its time
quantum, and its priority level is boosted. (The time quantum for a
process can be increased to a maximum of 100 milliseconds.) When a
process blocks before using its entire time quantum, its time quantum is
reduced by 5 milliseconds, but its priority remains the same. What type
of process (CPU-bound or I/O-bound) does the regressive round-robin
scheduler favor? Explain.

CPU Scheduling
Programming Projects
Scheduling Algorithms
This project involves implementing several different process scheduling algo-
rithms. The scheduler will be assigned a predefined set of tasks and will
schedule the tasks based on the selected scheduling algorithm. Each task is
assigned a priority and CPU burst. The following scheduling algorithms will
be implemented:
• First-come, first-served (FCFS), which schedules tasks in the order in which
they request the CPU.
• Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the
tasks’ next CPU burst.
• Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority.
• Round-robin (RR) scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum
(or for the remainder of its CPU burst).
• Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and
uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.
Priorities range from 1 to 10, where a higher numeric value indicates a higher
relative priority. For round-robin scheduling, the length of a time quantum is
10 milliseconds.
I. Implementation
The implementation of this project may be completed in either C or Java, and
program files supporting both of these languages are provided in the source
code download for the text. These supporting files read in the schedule of tasks,
insert the tasks into a list, and invoke the scheduler.
The schedule of tasks has the form [task name] [priority] [CPU burst], with
the following example format:
T1, 4, 20
T2, 2, 25
T3, 3, 25
T4, 3, 15
T5, 10, 10
Thus, task T1 has priority 4 and a CPU burst of 20 milliseconds, and so forth. It
is assumed that all tasks arrive at the same time, so your scheduler algorithms
do not have to support higher-priority processes preempting processes with
lower priorities. In addition, tasks do not have to be placed into a queue or list
in any particular order.
There are a few different strategies for organizing the list of tasks, as
first presented in Section 5.1.2. One approach is to place all tasks in a single
unordered list, where the strategy for task selection depends on the scheduling

algorithm. For example, SJF scheduling would search the list to find the task
with the shortest next CPU burst. Alternatively, a list could be ordered accord-
ing to scheduling criteria (that is, by priority). One other strategy involves
having a separate queue for each unique priority, as shown in Figure 5.7. These
approaches are briefly discussed in Section 5.3.6. It is also worth highlight-
ing that we are using the terms list and queue somewhat interchangeably.
However, a queue has very specific FIFO functionality, whereas a list does not
have such strict insertion and deletion requirements. You are likely to find the
functionality of a general list to be more suitable when completing this project.
II. C Implementation Details
The file driver.c reads in the schedule of tasks, inserts each task into a linked
list, and invokes the process scheduler by calling the schedule() function. The
schedule() function executes each task according to the specified scheduling
algorithm. Tasks selected for execution on the CPU are determined by the pick-
NextTask() function and are executed by invoking the run() function defined
in the CPU.c file. AMakefile is used to determine the specific scheduling algo-
rithm that will be invoked by driver. For example, to build the FCFS scheduler,
we would enter
make fcfs
and would execute the scheduler (using the schedule of tasks schedule.txt)
as follows:
./fcfs schedule.txt
Refer to the README file in the source code download for further details. Before
proceeding, be sure to familiarize yourself with the source code provided as
well as the Makefile.
III. Java Implementation Details
The file Driver.java reads in the schedule of tasks, inserts each task into a
Java ArrayList, and invokes the process scheduler by calling the schedule()
method. The following interface identifies a generic scheduling algorithm,
which the five different scheduling algorithms will implement:
public interface Algorithm
{
// Implementation of scheduling algorithm
public void schedule();
// Selects the next task to be scheduled
public Task pickNetTask();
}
The schedule() method obtains the next task to be run on the CPU by invok-
ing the pickNextTask() method and then executes this Task by calling the
static run() method in the CPU.java class.
The program is run as follows:
java Driver fcfs schedule.txt

proceeding, be sure to familiarize yourself with all Java source files provided
in the source code download.
IV. Further Challenges
Two additional challenges are presented for this project:
1. Each task provided to the scheduler is assigned a unique task (tid).
If a scheduler is running in an SMP environment where each CPU is
separately running its own scheduler, there is a possible race condition on
the variable that is used to assign task identifiers. Fix this race condition
using an atomic integer.
On Linux and macOS systems, the
sync fetch and add() function
can be used to atomically increment an integer value. As an example, the
following code sample atomically increments value by 1:
int value = 0;
sync fetch and add(&value,1);
Refer to the Java API for details on how to use the AtomicInteger class
for Java programs.
2. Calculate the average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time
for each of the scheduling algorithms.
