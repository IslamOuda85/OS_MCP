C H A P T E R
Threads &
Concurrency
The process model introduced in Chapter 3 assumed that a process was an
executing program with a single thread of control. Virtually all modern operat-
ing systems, however, provide features enabling a process to contain multiple
threads of control. Identifying opportunities for parallelism through the use of
threads is becoming increasingly important for modern multicore systems that
provide multiple CPUs.
In this chapter, we introduce many concepts, as well as challenges, associ-
ated with multithreaded computer systems, including a discussion of the APIs
for the Pthreads, Windows, and Java thread libraries. Additionally, we explore
several new features that abstract the concept of creating threads, allowing
developers to focus on identifying opportunities for parallelism and letting
language features and API frameworks manage the details of thread creation
and management. We look at a number of issues related to multithreaded pro-
gramming and its effect on the design of operating systems. Finally, we explore
how the Windows and Linux operating systems support threads at the kernel
level.

## 4.1 Overview

A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprises a thread ID, a program
counter (PC), a register set, and a stack. It shares with other threads belonging
to the same process its code section, data section, and other operating-system
resources, such as open files and signals. A traditional process has a single
thread of control. If a process has multiple threads of control, it can perform
more than one task at a time. Figure 4.1 illustrates the difference between a
traditional single-threaded process and a multithreaded process.
Motivation
Most software applications that run on modern computers and mobile devices
are multithreaded. An application typically is implemented as a separate pro-
cess with several threads of control. Below we highlight a few examples of
multithreaded applications:
• An application that creates photo thumbnails from a collection of images
may use a separate thread to generate a thumbnail from each separate
image.
• Aweb browser might have one thread display images or text while another
thread retrieves data from the network.
• A word processor may have a thread for displaying graphics, another
thread for responding to keystrokes from the user, and a third thread for
performing spelling and grammar checking in the background.

**Grand Central Dispatch**

- Apple technology for macOS and iOS operating systems
- Extensions to C, C++ and Objective-C languages, API, and run-time library
- Allows identification of parallel sections
- Manages most of the details of threading
- Block is in “^{ }” : ˆ{ printf("I am a block"); }
- Blocks placed in dispatch queue
  - Assigned to available thread in thread pool when removed from queue


**Grand Central Dispatch**

- Two types of dispatch queues:
  - serial – blocks removed in FIFO order, queue is per process, called main queue
    - Programmers can create additional serial queues within program
  - concurrent – removed in FIFO order but several may be removed at a time
    - Four system wide queues divided by quality of service:
    - QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE
    - QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED
    - QOS_CLASS_USER_UTILITY
    - QOS_CLASS_USER_BACKGROUND


**Grand Central Dispatch**

- For the Swift language a task is defined as a closure – similar to a block, minus the caret
- Closures are submitted to the queue using the dispatch_async() function:

- Operating System Examples
- Windows Threads
- Linux Threads


**Windows Threads**

- Windows API – primary API for Windows applications
- Implements the one-to-one mapping, kernel-level
- Each thread contains
  - A thread id
  - Register set representing state of processor
  - Separate user and kernel stacks for when thread runs in user mode or kernel mode
  - Private data storage area used by run-time libraries and dynamic link libraries (DLLs)
- The register set, stacks, and private storage area are known as the context of the thread


**Windows Threads (Cont.)**

- The primary data structures of a thread include:
  - ETHREAD (executive thread block) – includes pointer to process to which thread belongs and to KTHREAD, in kernel space
  - KTHREAD (kernel thread block) – scheduling and synchronization info, kernel-mode stack, pointer to TEB, in kernel space
  - TEB (thread environment block) – thread id, user-mode stack, thread-local storage, in user space

## 4.1 Overview
> id: ch04-4-1 | src: book 4.1 | kind: concept

Applications can also be designed to leverage processing capabilities on mul-
ticore systems. Such applications can perform several CPU-intensive tasks in
parallel across the multiple computing cores.
In certain situations, a single application may be required to perform sev-
eral similar tasks. For example, a web server accepts client requests for web
pages, images, sound, and so forth. A busy web server may have several (per-
haps thousands of) clients concurrently accessing it. If the web server ran as a
traditional single-threaded process, it would be able to service only one client
at a time, and a client might have to wait a very long time for its request to be
serviced.
One solution is to have the server run as a single process that accepts
requests. When the server receives a request, it creates a separate process
to service that request. In fact, this process-creation method was in common
use before threads became popular. Process creation is time consuming and
resource intensive, however. If the new process will perform the same tasks as
the existing process, why incur all that overhead? It is generally more efficient
to use one process that contains multiple threads. If the web-server process is
multithreaded, the server will create a separate thread that listens for client
requests. When a request is made, rather than creating another process, the
server creates a new thread to service the request and resumes listening for
additional requests. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2.
Most operating system kernels are also typically multithreaded. As an
example, during system boot time on Linux systems, several kernel threads
are created. Each thread performs a specific task, such as managing devices,
memory management, or interrupt handling. The command ps -ef can be
used to display the kernel threads on a running Linux system. Examining the
output of this command will show the kernel thread kthreadd (with pid = 2),
which serves as the parent of all other kernel threads.
Many applications can also take advantage of multiple threads, including
basic sorting, trees, and graph algorithms. In addition, programmers who must
solve contemporary CPU-intensive problems in data mining, graphics, and
artificial intelligence can leverage the power of modern multicore systems by
designing solutions that run in parallel.

Threads & Concurrency
Beneﬁts
The benefits of multithreaded programming can be broken down into four
major categories:
1. Responsiveness. Multithreading an interactive application may allow a
program to continue running even if part of it is blocked or is perform-
ing a lengthy operation, thereby increasing responsiveness to the user.
This quality is especially useful in designing user interfaces. For instance,
consider what happens when a user clicks a button that results in the
performance of a time-consuming operation. A single-threaded appli-
cation would be unresponsive to the user until the operation had been
completed. In contrast, if the time-consuming operation is performed in
a separate, asynchronous thread, the application remains responsive to
the user.
2. Resource sharing. Processes can share resources only through techniques
such as shared memory and message passing. Such techniques must
be explicitly arranged by the programmer. However, threads share the
memory and the resources of the process to which they belong by default.
The benefit of sharing code and data is that it allows an application to
have several different threads of activity within the same address space.
3. Economy. Allocating memory and resources for process creation is
costly. Because threads share the resources of the process to which they
belong, it is more economical to create and context-switch threads.
Empirically gauging the difference in overhead can be difficult, but in
general thread creation consumes less time and memory than process
creation. Additionally, context switching is typically faster between
threads than between processes.
4. Scalability. The benefits of multithreading can be even greater in a mul-
tiprocessor architecture, where threads may be running in parallel on
different processing cores. A single-threaded process can run on only
one processor, regardless how many are available. We explore this issue
further in the following section.


## 4.2 Multicore Programming
> id: ch04-4-2 | src: book 4.2; slides 8-11 | kind: concept

Earlier in the history of computer design, in response to the need for more
computing performance, single-CPU systems evolved into multi-CPU systems.
A later, yet similar, trend in system design is to place multiple computing
cores on a single processing chip where each core appears as a separate CPU
to the operating system (Section 1.3.2). We refer to such systems as multicore,
and multithreaded programming provides a mechanism for more efficient
use of these multiple computing cores and improved concurrency. Consider
an application with four threads. On a system with a single computing core,
concurrency merely means that the execution of the threads will be interleaved
over time (Figure 4.3), because the processing core is capable of executing only
one thread at a time. On a system with multiple cores, however, concurrency


- Multicore or multiprocessor systems puts pressure on programmers, challenges include:
  - Dividing activities
  - Balance
  - Data splitting
  - Data dependency
  - Testing and debugging
- Parallelism implies a system can perform more than one task simultaneously
- Concurrency supports more than one task making progress
  - Single processor / core, scheduler providing concurrency


**Concurrency vs. Parallelism**

- Concurrent execution on single-core system:
- Parallelism on a multi-core system:

means that some threads can run in parallel, because the system can assign a
separate thread to each core (Figure 4.4).
Notice the distinction between concurrency and parallelism in this discus-
sion. Aconcurrent system supports more than one task by allowing all the tasks
to make progress. In contrast, a parallel system can perform more than one task
simultaneously. Thus, it is possible to have concurrency without parallelism.
Before the advent of multiprocessor and multicore architectures, most com-
puter systems had only a single processor, and CPU schedulers were designed
to provide the illusion of parallelism by rapidly switching between processes,
thereby allowing each process to make progress. Such processes were running
concurrently, but not in parallel.
Programming Challenges
The trend toward multicore systems continues to place pressure on system
designers and application programmers to make better use of the multiple
computing cores. Designers of operating systems must write scheduling algo-
rithms that use multiple processing cores to allow the parallel execution shown
in Figure 4.4. For application programmers, the challenge is to modify existing
programs as well as design new programs that are multithreaded.
In general, five areas present challenges in programming for multicore
systems:
1. Identifying tasks. This involves examining applications to find areas
that can be divided into separate, concurrent tasks. Ideally, tasks are
independent of one another and thus can run in parallel on individual
cores.
2. Balance. While identifying tasks that can run in parallel, programmers
must also ensure that the tasks perform equal work of equal value. In
some instances, a certain task may not contribute as much value to the
overall process as other tasks. Using a separate execution core to run that
task may not be worth the cost.

AMDAHL’S LAW
Amdahl’s Law is a formula that identifies potential performance gains from
adding additional computing cores to an application that has both serial
(nonparallel) and parallel components. If S is the portion of the application
that must be performed serially on a system with N processing cores, the
formula appears as follows:
speedup ≤
S + (1−S)
N
As an example, assume we have an application that is 75 percent parallel and
25 percent serial. If we run this application on a system with two processing
cores, we can get a speedup of 1.6 times. If we add two additional cores
(for a total of four), the speedup is 2.28 times. Below is a graph illustrating
Amdahl’s Law in several different scenarios.
Speedup
Number of Processing Cores
Ideal Speedup
S = 0.05
S = 0.10
S = 0.50
One interesting fact about Amdahl’s Law is that as N approaches infinity,
the speedup converges to 1∕S. For example, if 50 percent of an application
is performed serially, the maximum speedup is 2.0 times, regardless of the
number of processing cores we add. This is the fundamental principle behind
Amdahl’s Law: the serial portion of an application can have a dispropor-
tionate effect on the performance we gain by adding additional computing
cores.
3. Data splitting. Just as applications are divided into separate tasks, the
data accessed and manipulated by the tasks must be divided to run on
separate cores.
4. Data dependency. The data accessed by the tasks must be examined for
dependencies between two or more tasks. When one task depends on
data from another, programmers must ensure that the execution of the
tasks is synchronized to accommodate the data dependency. We examine
such strategies in Chapter 6.

5. Testing and debugging. When a program is running in parallel on multi-
ple cores, many different execution paths are possible. Testing and debug-
ging such concurrent programs is inherently more difficult than testing
and debugging single-threaded applications.
Because of these challenges, many software developers argue that the advent of
multicore systems will require an entirely new approach to designing software
systems in the future. (Similarly, many computer science educators believe that
software development must be taught with increased emphasis on parallel
programming.)
Types of Parallelism
In general, there are two types of parallelism: data parallelism and task par-
allelism. Data parallelism focuses on distributing subsets of the same data
across multiple computing cores and performing the same operation on each
core. Consider, for example, summing the contents of an array of size N. On a
single-core system, one thread would simply sum the elements [0] ...[N −1].
On a dual-core system, however, thread A, running on core 0, could sum the
elements [0] ...[N∕2 −1] while thread B, running on core 1, could sum the
elements [N∕2] ...[N −1]. The two threads would be running in parallel on
separate computing cores.
Task parallelism involves distributing not data but tasks (threads) across
multiple computing cores. Each thread is performing a unique operation. Dif-
ferent threads may be operating on the same data, or they may be operating on
different data. Consider again our example above. In contrast to that situation,
an example of task parallelism might involve two threads, each performing
a unique statistical operation on the array of elements. The threads again are
operating in parallel on separate computing cores, but each is performing a
unique operation.
Fundamentally, then, data parallelism involves the distribution of data
across multiple cores, and task parallelism involves the distribution of tasks
across multiple cores, as shown in Figure 4.5. However, data and task paral-

lelism are not mutually exclusive, and an application may in fact use a hybrid
of these two strategies.


## 4.3 Multithreading Models
> id: ch04-4-3 | src: book 4.3; slides 16-20 | kind: concept

Our discussion so far has treated threads in a generic sense. However, support
for threads may be provided either at the user level, for user threads, or by the
kernel, for kernel threads. User threads are supported above the kernel and
are managed without kernel support, whereas kernel threads are supported
and managed directly by the operating system. Virtually all contemporary
operating systems—including Windows, Linux, and macOS— support kernel
threads.
Ultimately, a relationship must exist between user threads and kernel
threads, as illustrated in Figure 4.6. In this section, we look at three common
ways of establishing such a relationship: the many-to-one model, the one-to-
one model, and the many-to-many model.
Many-to-One Model
The many-to-one model (Figure 4.7) maps many user-level threads to one
kernel thread. Thread management is done by the thread library in user space,
so it is efficient (we discuss thread libraries in Section 4.4). However, the entire
process will block if a thread makes a blocking system call. Also, because only

**Many-to-One**

- Many user-level threads mapped to single kernel thread
- One thread blocking causes all to block
- Multiple threads may not run in parallel on multicore system because only one may be in kernel at a time
- Few systems currently use this model
- Examples:
  - Solaris Green Threads
  - GNU Portable Threads

**One-to-One**

- Each user-level thread maps to kernel thread
- Creating a user-level thread creates a kernel thread
- More concurrency than many-to-one
- Number of threads per process sometimes restricted due to overhead
- Examples
  - Windows
  - Linux

**Many-to-Many Model**

- Allows many user level threads to be mapped to many kernel threads
- Allows the  operating system to create a sufficient number of kernel threads
- Windows  with the ThreadFiber package
- Otherwise not very common

one thread can access the kernel at a time, multiple threads are unable to run
in parallel on multicore systems. Green threads—a thread library available
for Solaris systems and adopted in early versions of Java—used the many-to-
one model. However, very few systems continue to use the model because of
its inability to take advantage of multiple processing cores, which have now
become standard on most computer systems.
One-to-One Model
The one-to-one model (Figure 4.8) maps each user thread to a kernel thread. It
provides more concurrency than the many-to-one model by allowing another
thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call. It also allows mul-
tiple threads to run in parallel on multiprocessors. The only drawback to this
model is that creating a user thread requires creating the corresponding kernel
thread, and a large number of kernel threads may burden the performance of
a system. Linux, along with the family of Windows operating systems, imple-
ment the one-to-one model.
Many-to-Many Model
The many-to-many model (Figure 4.9) multiplexes many user-level threads to
a smaller or equal number of kernel threads. The number of kernel threads
may be specific to either a particular application or a particular machine (an
application may be allocated more kernel threads on a system with eight
processing cores than a system with four cores).

Let’s consider the effect of this design on concurrency. Whereas the many-
to-one model allows the developer to create as many user threads as she
wishes, it does not result in parallelism, because the kernel can schedule only
one kernel thread at a time. The one-to-one model allows greater concurrency,
but the developer has to be careful not to create too many threads within an
application. (In fact, on some systems, she may be limited in the number of
threads she can create.) The many-to-many model suffers from neither of these
shortcomings: developers can create as many user threads as necessary, and
the corresponding kernel threads can run in parallel on a multiprocessor. Also,
when a thread performs a blocking system call, the kernel can schedule another
thread for execution.
One variation on the many-to-many model still multiplexes many user-
level threads to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads but also allows a
user-level thread to be bound to a kernel thread. This variation is sometimes
referred to as the two-level model (Figure 4.10).
Although the many-to-many model appears to be the most flexible of the
models discussed, in practice it is difficult to implement. In addition, with an
increasing number of processing cores appearing on most systems, limiting
the number of kernel threads has become less important. As a result, most
operating systems now use the one-to-one model. However, as we shall see in
Section 4.5, some contemporary concurrency libraries have developers identify
tasks that are then mapped to threads using the many-to-many model.


## 4.4 Thread Libraries
> id: ch04-4-4 | src: book 4.4; slides 21-32 | kind: concept

A thread library provides the programmer with an API for creating and man-
aging threads. There are two primary ways of implementing a thread library.
The first approach is to provide a library entirely in user space with no kernel
support. All code and data structures for the library exist in user space. This
means that invoking a function in the library results in a local function call in
user space and not a system call.
The second approach is to implement a kernel-level library supported
directly by the operating system. In this case, code and data structures for
the library exist in kernel space. Invoking a function in the API for the library
typically results in a system call to the kernel.

## 4.4 Thread Libraries
> id: ch04-4-4 | src: book 4.4 | kind: concept

Three main thread libraries are in use today: POSIX Pthreads, Windows, and
Java. Pthreads, the threads extension of the POSIX standard, may be provided
as either a user-level or a kernel-level library. The Windows thread library
is a kernel-level library available on Windows systems. The Java thread API
allows threads to be created and managed directly in Java programs. However,
because in most instances the JVM is running on top of a host operating system,
the Java thread API is generally implemented using a thread library available
on the host system. This means that on Windows systems, Java threads are typ-
ically implemented using the Windows API; UNIX, Linux, and macOS systems
typically use Pthreads.
For POSIX and Windows threading, any data declared globally—that is,
declared outside of any function—are shared among all threads belonging to
the same process. Because Java has no equivalent notion of global data, access
to shared data must be explicitly arranged between threads.
In the remainder of this section, we describe basic thread creation using
these three thread libraries. As an illustrative example, we design a multi-
threaded program that performs the summation of a non-negative integer in a
separate thread using the well-known summation function:
sum =
N
∑
i=1
i
For example, if N were 5, this function would represent the summation of
integers from 1 to 5, which is 15. Each of the three programs will be run with
the upper bounds of the summation entered on the command line. Thus, if the
user enters 8, the summation of the integer values from 1 to 8 will be output.
Before we proceed with our examples of thread creation, we introduce
two general strategies for creating multiple threads: asynchronous threading
and synchronous threading. With asynchronous threading, once the parent
creates a child thread, the parent resumes its execution, so that the parent
and child execute concurrently and independently of one another. Because
the threads are independent, there is typically little data sharing between
them. Asynchronous threading is the strategy used in the multithreaded server
illustrated in Figure 4.2 and is also commonly used for designing responsive
user interfaces.
Synchronous threading occurs when the parent thread creates one or more
children and then must wait for all of its children to terminate before it resumes.
Here, the threads created by the parent perform work concurrently, but the
parent cannot continue until this work has been completed. Once each thread
has finished its work, it terminates and joins with its parent. Only after all of the
children have joined can the parent resume execution. Typically, synchronous
threading involves significant data sharing among threads. For example, the
parent thread may combine the results calculated by its various children. All
of the following examples use synchronous threading.
Pthreads
Pthreads refers to the POSIX standard (IEEE 1003.1c) defining an API for thread
creation and synchronization. This is a specification for thread behavior, not an
implementation. Operating-system designers may implement the specification
Threads & Concurrency
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int sum; /* this data is shared by the thread(s) */
void *runner(void *param); /* threads call this function */
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
pthread t tid; /* the thread identifier */
pthread attr t attr; /* set of thread attributes */
/* set the default attributes of the thread */
pthread attr init(&attr);
/* create the thread */
pthread create(&tid, &attr, runner, argv[1]);
/* wait for the thread to exit */
pthread join(tid,NULL);
printf("sum = %d∖n",sum);
}
/* The thread will execute in this function */
void *runner(void *param)
{
int i, upper = atoi(param);
sum = 0;
for (i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
sum += i;
pthread exit(0);
}

in any way they wish. Numerous systems implement the Pthreads specifica-
tion; most are UNIX-type systems, including Linux and macOS. Although Win-
dows doesn’t support Pthreads natively, some third-party implementations for
Windows are available.
The C program shown in Figure 4.11 demonstrates the basic Pthreads API
for constructing a multithreaded program that calculates the summation of
a non-negative integer in a separate thread. In a Pthreads program, separate
threads begin execution in a specified function. In Figure 4.11, this is the run-
ner() function. When this program begins, a single thread of control begins in


## 4.4 Thread Libraries
> id: ch04-4-4 | src: book 4.4 | kind: concept

#define NUM THREADS 10
/* an array of threads to be joined upon */
pthread t workers[NUM THREADS];
for (int i = 0; i < NUM THREADS; i++)
pthread join(workers[i], NULL);
Figure 4.12
Pthread code for joining ten threads.
main(). After some initialization, main() creates a second thread that begins
control in the runner() function. Both threads share the global data sum.
Let’s look more closely at this program. All Pthreads programs must
include the pthread.h header file. The statement pthread t tid declares the
identifier for the thread we will create. Each thread has a set of attributes,
including stack size and scheduling information. The pthread attr t attr
declaration represents the attributes for the thread. We set the attributes in
the function call pthread attr init(&attr). Because we did not explicitly
set any attributes, we use the default attributes provided. (In Chapter 5, we
discuss some of the scheduling attributes provided by the Pthreads API.) A
separate thread is created with the pthread create() function call. In addi-
tion to passing the thread identifier and the attributes for the thread, we also
pass the name of the function where the new thread will begin execution—in
this case, the runner() function. Last, we pass the integer parameter that was
provided on the command line, argv[1].
At this point, the program has two threads: the initial (or parent) thread in
main() and the summation (or child) thread performing the summation oper-
ation in the runner() function. This program follows the thread create/join
strategy, whereby after creating the summation thread, the parent thread will
wait for it to terminate by calling the pthread join() function. The summa-
tion thread will terminate when it calls the function pthread exit(). Once the
summation thread has returned, the parent thread will output the value of the
shared data sum.
This example program creates only a single thread. With the growing
dominance of multicore systems, writing programs containing several threads
has become increasingly common. A simple method for waiting on several
threads using the pthread join() function is to enclose the operation within
a simple for loop. For example, you can join on ten threads using the Pthread
code shown in Figure 4.12.
Windows Threads
The technique for creating threads using the Windows thread library is similar
to the Pthreads technique in several ways. We illustrate the Windows thread
API in the C program shown in Figure 4.13. Notice that we must include the
windows.h header file when using the Windows API.
Threads & Concurrency
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
DWORD Sum; /* data is shared by the thread(s) */
/* The thread will execute in this function */
DWORD WINAPI Summation(LPVOID Param)
{
DWORD Upper = *(DWORD*)Param;
for (DWORD i = 1; i <= Upper; i++)
Sum += i;
return 0;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
DWORD ThreadId;
HANDLE ThreadHandle;
int Param;
Param = atoi(argv[1]);
/* create the thread */
ThreadHandle = CreateThread(
NULL, /* default security attributes */
0, /* default stack size */
Summation, /* thread function */
&Param, /* parameter to thread function */
0, /* default creation flags */
&ThreadId); /* returns the thread identifier */
/* now wait for the thread to finish */
WaitForSingleObject(ThreadHandle,INFINITE);
/* close the thread handle */
CloseHandle(ThreadHandle);
printf("sum = %d∖n",Sum);
}
Figure 4.13
Multithreaded C program using the Windows API.
Just as in the Pthreads version shown in Figure 4.11, data shared by the
separate threads—in this case, Sum—are declared globally (the DWORD data
type is an unsigned 32-bit integer). We also define the Summation() function
that is to be performed in a separate thread. This function is passed a pointer
to a void, which Windows defines as LPVOID. The thread performing this
function sets the global data Sum to the value of the summation from 0 to the
parameter passed to Summation().


## 4.4 Thread Libraries
> id: ch04-4-4 | src: book 4.4 | kind: concept

Threads are created in the Windows API using the CreateThread() func-
tion, and—just as in Pthreads—a set of attributes for the thread is passed
to this function. These attributes include security information, the size of the
stack, and a flag that can be set to indicate if the thread is to start in a suspended
state. In this program, we use the default values for these attributes. (The
default values do not initially set the thread to a suspended state and instead
make it eligible to be run by the CPU scheduler.) Once the summation thread
is created, the parent must wait for it to complete before outputting the value
of Sum, as the value is set by the summation thread. Recall that the Pthread
program (Figure 4.11) had the parent thread wait for the summation thread
using the pthread join() statement. We perform the equivalent of this in the
Windows API using the WaitForSingleObject() function, which causes the
creating thread to block until the summation thread has exited.
In situations that require waiting for multiple threads to complete, the
WaitForMultipleObjects() function is used. This function is passed four
parameters:
1. The number of objects to wait for
2. A pointer to the array of objects
3. A flag indicating whether all objects have been signaled
4. A timeout duration (or INFINITE)
For example, if THandles is an array of thread HANDLE objects of size N, the
parent thread can wait for all its child threads to complete with this statement:
WaitForMultipleObjects(N, THandles, TRUE, INFINITE);
Java Threads
Threads are the fundamental model of program execution in a Java program,
and the Java language and its API provide a rich set of features for the creation
and management of threads. All Java programs comprise at least a single
thread of control—even a simple Java program consisting of only a main()
method runs as a single thread in the JVM. Java threads are available on any
system that provides a JVM including Windows, Linux, and macOS. The Java
thread API is available for Android applications as well.
There are two techniques for explicitly creating threads in a Java program.
One approach is to create a new class that is derived from the Thread class
and to override its run() method. An alternative—and more commonly used
—technique is to define a class that implements the Runnable interface. This
interface defines a single abstract method with the signature public void
run(). The code in the run() method of a class that implements Runnable
is what executes in a separate thread. An example is shown below:
class Task implements Runnable
{
public void run() {
System.out.println("I am a thread.");
}
}
Threads & Concurrency
LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS IN JAVA
Beginning with Version 1.8 of the language, Java introduced Lambda expres-
sions, which allow a much cleaner syntax for creating threads. Rather than
defining a separate class that implements Runnable, a Lambda expression
can be used instead:
Runnable task = () -> {
System.out.println("I am a thread.");
};
Thread worker = new Thread(task);
worker.start();
Lambda expressions—as well as similar functions known as closures—are
a prominent feature of functional programming languages and have been
available in several nonfunctional languages as well including Python, C++,
and C#. As we shall see in later examples in this chapter, Lamdba expressions
often provide a simple syntax for developing parallel applications.
Thread creation in Java involves creating a Thread object and passing it
an instance of a class that implements Runnable, followed by invoking the
start() method on the Thread object. This appears in the following example:
Thread worker = new Thread(new Task());
worker.start();
Invoking the start() method for the new Thread object does two things:
1. It allocates memory and initializes a new thread in the JVM.
2. It calls the run() method, making the thread eligible to be run by the JVM.
(Note again that we never call the run() method directly. Rather, we call
the start() method, and it calls the run() method on our behalf.)
Recall that the parent threads in the Pthreads and Windows libraries use
pthread join() and WaitForSingleObject() (respectively) to wait for the
summation threads to finish before proceeding. The join() method in Java
provides similar functionality. (Notice that join() can throw an Interrupt-
edException, which we choose to ignore.)
try {
worker.join();
}
catch (InterruptedException ie) { }
If the parent must wait for several threads to finish, the join() method can be
enclosed in a for loop similar to that shown for Pthreads in Figure 4.12.


## 4.4 Thread Libraries
> id: ch04-4-4 | src: book 4.4 | kind: concept

Java Executor Framework
Java has supported thread creation using the approach we have described thus
far since its origins. However, beginning with Version 1.5 and its API, Java
introduced several new concurrency features that provide developers with
much greater control over thread creation and communication. These tools are
available in the java.util.concurrent package.
Rather than explicitly creating Thread objects, thread creation is instead
organized around the Executor interface:
public interface Executor
{
void execute(Runnable command);
}
Classes implementing this interface must define the execute() method, which
is passed a Runnable object. For Java developers, this means using the Execu-
tor rather than creating a separate Thread object and invoking its start()
method. The Executor is used as follows:
Executor service = new Executor;
service.execute(new Task());
The Executor framework is based on the producer-consumer model; tasks
implementing the Runnable interface are produced, and the threads that exe-
cute these tasks consume them. The advantage of this approach is that it not
only divides thread creation from execution but also provides a mechanism for
communication between concurrent tasks.
Data sharing between threads belonging to the same process occurs easily
in Windows and Pthreads, since shared data are simply declared globally. As
a pure object-oriented language, Java has no such notion of global data. We
can pass parameters to a class that implements Runnable, but Java threads
cannot return results. To address this need, the java.util.concurrent pack-
age additionally defines the Callable interface, which behaves similarly to
Runnable except that a result can be returned. Results returned from Callable
tasks are known as Future objects. A result can be retrieved from the get()
method defined in the Future interface. The program shown in Figure 4.14
illustrates the summation program using these Java features.
The Summation class implements the Callable interface, which specifies
the method V call()—it is the code in this call() method that is executed
in a separate thread. To execute this code, we create a newSingleThreadEx-
ecutor object (provided as a static method in the Executors class), which is
of type ExecutorService, and pass it a Callable task using its submit()
method. (The primary difference between the execute() and submit() meth-
ods is that the former returns no result, whereas the latter returns a result as
a Future.) Once we submit the callable task to the thread, we wait for its
result by calling the get() method of the Future object it returns.
It is quite easy to notice at first that this model of thread creation appears
more complicated than simply creating a thread and joining on its termination.
However, incurring this modest degree of complication confers benefits. As we
have seen, using Callable and Future allows for threads to return results.
Threads & Concurrency
import java.util.concurrent.*;
class Summation implements Callable<Integer>
{
private int upper;
public Summation(int upper) {
this.upper = upper;
}
/* The thread will execute in this method */
public Integer call() {
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
sum += i;
return new Integer(sum);
}
}
public class Driver
{
public static void main(String[] args) {
int upper = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<Integer> result = pool.submit(new Summation(upper));
try {
System.out.println("sum = " + result.get());
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException ie) { }
}
}
Figure 4.14
Illustration of Java Executor framework API.
Additionally, this approach separates the creation of threads from the results
they produce: rather than waiting for a thread to terminate before retrieving
results, the parent instead only waits for the results to become available. Finally,
as we shall see in Section 4.5.1, this framework can be combined with other
features to create robust tools for managing a large number of threads.

**Thread Pools**

- Create a number of threads in a pool where they await work
- Advantages:
  - Usually slightly faster to service a request with an existing thread than create a new thread
  - Allows the number of threads in the application(s) to be bound to the size of the pool
  - Separating task to be performed from mechanics of creating task allows different strategies for running task
    - i.e,Tasks could be scheduled to run periodically
- Windows API supports thread pools:

## 4.5 Implicit Threading

THE JVM AND THE HOST OPERATING SYSTEM
The JVM is typically implemented on top of a host operating system (see
Figure 18.10). This setup allows the JVM to hide the implementation details
of the underlying operating system and to provide a consistent, abstract
environment that allows Java programs to operate on any platform that
supports a JVM. The specification for the JVM does not indicate how Java
threads are to be mapped to the underlying operating system, instead leaving
that decision to the particular implementation of the JVM. For example, the
Windows operating system uses the one-to-one model; therefore, each Java
thread for a JVM running on Windows maps to a kernel thread. In addition,
there may be a relationship between the Java thread library and the thread
library on the host operating system. For example, implementations of a JVM
for the Windows family of operating systems might use the Windows API
when creating Java threads; Linux and macOS systems might use the Pthreads
API.
address not only the challenges outlined in Section 4.2 but additional difficul-
ties as well. These difficulties, which relate to program correctness, are covered
in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8.
One way to address these difficulties and better support the design of con-
current and parallel applications is to transfer the creation and management
of threading from application developers to compilers and run-time libraries.
This strategy, termed implicit threading, is an increasingly popular trend. In
this section, we explore four alternative approaches to designing applications
that can take advantage of multicore processors through implicit threading.
As we shall see, these strategies generally require application developers to
identify tasks—not threads—that can run in parallel. A task is usually writ-
ten as a function, which the run-time library then maps to a separate thread,
typically using the many-to-many model (Section 4.3.3). The advantage of
this approach is that developers only need to identify parallel tasks, and the
libraries determine the specific details of thread creation and management.
Thread Pools
In Section 4.1, we described a multithreaded web server. In this situation,
whenever the server receives a request, it creates a separate thread to service
the request. Whereas creating a separate thread is certainly superior to creating
a separate process, a multithreaded server nonetheless has potential problems.
The first issue concerns the amount of time required to create the thread,
together with the fact that the thread will be discarded once it has completed
its work. The second issue is more troublesome. If we allow each concurrent
request to be serviced in a new thread, we have not placed a bound on the
number of threads concurrently active in the system. Unlimited threads could
exhaust system resources, such as CPU time or memory. One solution to this
problem is to use a thread pool.
Threads & Concurrency
ANDROID THREAD POOLS
In Section 3.8.2.1, we covered RPCs in the Android operating system. You
may recall from that section that Android uses the Android Interface Defi-
nition Language (AIDL), a tool that specifies the remote interface that clients
interact with on the server. AIDL also provides a thread pool. Aremote service
using the thread pool can handle multiple concurrent requests, servicing each
request using a separate thread from the pool.
The general idea behind a thread pool is to create a number of threads at
start-up and place them into a pool, where they sit and wait for work. When a
server receives a request, rather than creating a thread, it instead submits the
request to the thread pool and resumes waiting for additional requests. If there
is an available thread in the pool, it is awakened, and the request is serviced
immediately. If the pool contains no available thread, the task is queued until
one becomes free. Once a thread completes its service, it returns to the pool
and awaits more work. Thread pools work well when the tasks submitted to
the pool can be executed asynchronously.
Thread pools offer these benefits:
1. Servicing a request with an existing thread is often faster than waiting to
create a thread.
2. Athread pool limits the number of threads that exist at any one point. This
is particularly important on systems that cannot support a large number
of concurrent threads.
3. Separating the task to be performed from the mechanics of creating the
task allows us to use different strategies for running the task. For example,
the task could be scheduled to execute after a time delay or to execute
periodically.
The number of threads in the pool can be set heuristically based on factors
such as the number of CPUs in the system, the amount of physical memory, and
the expected number of concurrent client requests. More sophisticated thread-
pool architectures can dynamically adjust the number of threads in the pool
according to usage patterns. Such architectures provide the further benefit of
having a smaller pool—thereby consuming less memory—when the load on
the system is low. We discuss one such architecture, Apple’s Grand Central
Dispatch, later in this section.
The Windows API provides several functions related to thread pools. Using
the thread pool API is similar to creating a thread with the Thread Create()
function, as described in Section 4.4.2. Here, a function that is to run as a
separate thread is defined. Such a function may appear as follows:
DWORD WINAPI PoolFunction(PVOID Param) {
/* this function runs as a separate thread. */
}


## 4.5 Implicit Threading
> id: ch04-4-5 | src: book 4.5 | kind: concept

A pointer to PoolFunction() is passed to one of the functions in the thread
pool API, and a thread from the pool executes this function. One such member
in the thread pool API is the QueueUserWorkItem() function, which is passed
three parameters:
• LPTHREAD START ROUTINE Function—a pointer to the function that is to
run as a separate thread
• PVOID Param—the parameter passed to Function
• ULONG Flags—flags indicating how the thread pool is to create and man-
age execution of the thread
An example of invoking a function is the following:
QueueUserWorkItem(&PoolFunction, NULL, 0);
This causes a thread from the thread pool to invoke PoolFunction() on behalf
of the programmer. In this instance, we pass no parameters to PoolFunc-
tion(). Because we specify 0 as a flag, we provide the thread pool with no
special instructions for thread creation.
Other members in the Windows thread pool API include utilities that
invoke functions at periodic intervals or when an asynchronous I/O request
completes.
Java Thread Pools
The java.util.concurrent package includes an API for several varieties of
thread-pool architectures. Here, we focus on the following three models:
1. Single thread executor—newSingleThreadExecutor()—creates a pool
of size 1.
2. Fixed thread executor—newFixedThreadPool(int size)—creates a
thread pool with a specified number of threads.
3. Cached
thread
executor—newCachedThreadPool()—creates
an
unbounded thread pool, reusing threads in many instances.
We have, in fact, already seen the use of a Java thread pool in Section
shown in Figure 4.14. In that section, we noted that the Java executor frame-
work can be used to construct more robust threading tools. We now describe
how it can be used to create thread pools.
Athread pool is created using one of the factory methods in the Executors
class:
• static ExecutorService newSingleThreadExecutor()
• static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int size)
• static ExecutorService newCachedThreadPool()
Each of these factory methods creates and returns an object instance that imple-
ments the ExecutorService interface. ExecutorService extends the Execu-

for (int i = 0; i < numTasks; i++)
pool.execute(new Task());

pool.shutdown();
}

tor interface, allowing us to invoke the execute() method on this object. In
addition, ExecutorService provides methods for managing termination of
the thread pool.
The example shown in Figure 4.15 creates a cached thread pool and submits
tasks to be executed by a thread in the pool using the execute() method. When
the shutdown() method is invoked, the thread pool rejects additional tasks and
shuts down once all existing tasks have completed execution.
Fork Join
The strategy for thread creation covered in Section 4.4 is often known as the
fork-join model. Recall that with this method, the main parent thread creates
(forks) one or more child threads and then waits for the children to terminate
and join with it, at which point it can retrieve and combine their results. This
synchronous model is often characterized as explicit thread creation, but it
is also an excellent candidate for implicit threading. In the latter situation,
threads are not constructed directly during the fork stage; rather, parallel tasks
are designated. This model is illustrated in Figure 4.16. A library manages the
number of threads that are created and is also responsible for assigning tasks to
threads. In some ways, this fork-join model is a synchronous version of thread
pools in which a library determines the actual number of threads to create—
for example, by using the heuristics described in Section 4.5.1.
Fork Join in Java
Java introduced a fork-join library in Version 1.7 of the API that is designed
to be used with recursive divide-and-conquer algorithms such as Quicksort
and Mergesort. When implementing divide-and-conquer algorithms using this

library, separate tasks are forked during the divide step and assigned smaller
subsets of the original problem. Algorithms must be designed so that these
separate tasks can execute concurrently. At some point, the size of the problem
assigned to a task is small enough that it can be solved directly and requires
creating no additional tasks. The general recursive algorithm behind Java’s
fork-join model is shown below:
Task(problem)
if problem is small enough
solve the problem directly
else
subtask1 = fork(new Task(subset of problem)
subtask2 = fork(new Task(subset of problem)
result1 = join(subtask1)
result2 = join(subtask2)
return combined results
Figure 4.17 depicts the model graphically.
We now illustrate Java’s fork-join strategy by designing a divide-and-
conquer algorithm that sums all elements in an array of integers. In Version 1.7
of the API Java introduced a new thread pool—the ForkJoinPool—that can
be assigned tasks that inherit the abstract base class ForkJoinTask (which for
now we will assume is the SumTask class). The following creates a ForkJoin-
Pool object and submits the initial task via its invoke() method:
ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
// array contains the integers to be summed
int[] array = new int[SIZE];
SumTask task = new SumTask(0, SIZE - 1, array);
int sum = pool.invoke(task);
Upon completion, the initial call to invoke() returns the summation of array.
The class SumTask—shown in Figure 4.18—implements a divide-and-
conquer algorithm that sums the contents of the array using fork-join. New
tasks are created using the fork() method, and the compute() method speci-
fies the computation that is performed by each task. The method compute() is
invoked until it can directly calculate the sum of the subset it is assigned. The

call to join() blocks until the task completes, upon which join() returns the
results calculated in compute().
Notice that SumTask in Figure 4.18 extends RecursiveTask. The Java fork-
join strategy is organized around the abstract base class ForkJoinTask, and
the RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction classes extend this class. The fun-
damental difference between these two classes is that RecursiveTask returns
a result (via the return value specified in compute()), and RecursiveAction
does not return a result. The relationship between the three classes is illustrated
in the UML class diagram in Figure 4.19.
An important issue to consider is determining when the problem is “small
enough” to be solved directly and no longer requires creating additional tasks.
In SumTask, this occurs when the number of elements being summed is less
than the value THRESHOLD, which in Figure 4.18 we have arbitrarily set to 1,000.
In practice, determining when a problem can be solved directly requires careful
timing trials, as the value can vary according to implementation.
What is interesting in Java’s fork-join model is the management of tasks
wherein the library constructs a pool of worker threads and balances the load
of tasks among the available workers. In some situations, there are thousands
of tasks, yet only a handful of threads performing the work (for example, a
separate thread for each CPU). Additionally, each thread in a ForkJoinPool
maintains a queue of tasks that it has forked, and if a thread’s queue is empty,
it can steal a task from another thread’s queue using a work stealing algorithm,
thus balancing the workload of tasks among all threads.

OpenMP
OpenMP is a set of compiler directives as well as an API for programs written in
C, C++, or FORTRAN that provides support for parallel programming in shared-
memory environments. OpenMP identifies parallel regions as blocks of code
that may run in parallel. Application developers insert compiler directives into
their code at parallel regions, and these directives instruct the OpenMP run-

time library to execute the region in parallel. The following C program illus-
trates a compiler directive above the parallel region containing the printf()
statement:
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
/* sequential code */
#pragma omp parallel
{
printf("I am a parallel region.");
}
/* sequential code */
return 0;
}
When OpenMP encounters the directive
#pragma omp parallel
it creates as many threads as there are processing cores in the system. Thus, for
a dual-core system, two threads are created; for a quad-core system, four are
created; and so forth. All the threads then simultaneously execute the parallel
region. As each thread exits the parallel region, it is terminated.
OpenMP provides several additional directives for running code regions
in parallel, including parallelizing loops. For example, assume we have two
arrays, a and b, of size N. We wish to sum their contents and place the results


## 4.5 Implicit Threading
> id: ch04-4-5 | src: book 4.5 | kind: concept

in array c. We can have this task run in parallel by using the following code
segment, which contains the compiler directive for parallelizing for loops:
#pragma omp parallel for
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}
OpenMP divides the work contained in the for loop among the threads it has
created in response to the directive
#pragma omp parallel for
In addition to providing directives for parallelization, OpenMP allows
developers to choose among several levels of parallelism. For example, they
can set the number of threads manually. It also allows developers to identify
whether data are shared between threads or are private to a thread. OpenMP
is available on several open-source and commercial compilers for Linux, Win-
dows, and macOS systems. We encourage readers interested in learning more
about OpenMP to consult the bibliography at the end of the chapter.
Grand Central Dispatch
Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is a technology developed by Apple for its
macOS and iOS operating systems. It is a combination of a run-time library,
an API, and language extensions that allow developers to identify sections of
code (tasks) to run in parallel. Like OpenMP, GCD manages most of the details
of threading.
GCD schedules tasks for run-time execution by placing them on a dispatch
queue. When it removes a task from a queue, it assigns the task to an available
thread from a pool of threads that it manages. GCD identifies two types of
dispatch queues: serial and concurrent.
Tasks placed on a serial queue are removed in FIFO order. Once a task has
been removed from the queue, it must complete execution before another task
is removed. Each process has its own serial queue (known as its main queue),
and developers can create additional serial queues that are local to a particular
process. (This is why serial queues are also known as private dispatch queues.)
Serial queues are useful for ensuring the sequential execution of several tasks.
Tasks placed on a concurrent queue are also removed in FIFO order, but
several tasks may be removed at a time, thus allowing multiple tasks to execute
in parallel. There are several system-wide concurrent queues (also known as
global dispatch queues), which are divided into four primary quality-of-service
classes:
• QOS CLASS USER INTERACTIVE—The user-interactive class represents
tasks that interact with the user, such as the user interface and event
handling, to ensure a responsive user interface. Completing a task
belonging to this class should require only a small amount of work.
• QOS CLASS USER INITIATED—The user-initiated class is similar to the
user-interactive class in that tasks are associated with a responsive user
interface; however, user-initiated tasks may require longer processing
Threads & Concurrency
times. Opening a file or a URL is a user-initiated task, for example. Tasks
belonging to this class must be completed for the user to continue inter-
acting with the system, but they do not need to be serviced as quickly as
tasks in the user-interactive queue.
• QOS CLASS UTILITY —The utility class represents tasks that require a
longer time to complete but do not demand immediate results. This class
includes work such as importing data.
• QOS CLASS BACKGROUND —Tasks belonging to the background class are
not visible to the user and are not time sensitive. Examples include index-
ing a mailbox system and performing backups.
Tasks submitted to dispatch queues may be expressed in one of two
different ways:
1. For the C, C++, and Objective-C languages, GCD identifies a language
extension known as a block, which is simply a self-contained unit of
work. A block is specified by a caret ˆ inserted in front of a pair of braces
{ }. Code within the braces identifies the unit of work to be performed. A
simple example of a block is shown below:
^{ printf("I am a block"); }
2. For the Swift programming language, a task is defined using a closure,
which is similar to a block in that it expresses a self-contained unit of
functionality. Syntactically, a Swift closure is written in the same way as
a block, minus the leading caret.
The following Swift code segment illustrates obtaining a concurrent
queue for the user-initiated class and submitting a task to the queue using
the dispatch async() function:
let queue = dispatch get global queue
(QOS CLASS USER INITIATED, 0)
dispatch async(queue,{ print("I am a closure.") })
Internally, GCD’s thread pool is composed of POSIX threads. GCD actively
manages the pool, allowing the number of threads to grow and shrink accord-
ing to application demand and system capacity. GCD is implemented by the
libdispatch library, which Apple has released under the Apache Commons
license. It has since been ported to the FreeBSD operating system.
Intel Thread Building Blocks
Intel threading building blocks (TBB) is a template library that supports design-
ing parallel applications in C++. As this is a library, it requires no special
compiler or language support. Developers specify tasks that can run in par-


## 4.5 Implicit Threading
> id: ch04-4-5 | src: book 4.5 | kind: concept

allel, and the TBB task scheduler maps these tasks onto underlying threads.
Furthermore, the task scheduler provides load balancing and is cache aware,
meaning that it will give precedence to tasks that likely have their data stored
in cache memory and thus will execute more quickly. TBB provides a rich set
of features, including templates for parallel loop structures, atomic operations,
and mutual exclusion locking. In addition, it provides concurrent data struc-
tures, including a hash map, queue, and vector, which can serve as equivalent
thread-safe versions of the C++ standard template library data structures.
Let’s use parallel for loops as an example. Initially, assume there is a func-
tion named apply(float value) that performs an operation on the parameter
value. If we had an array v of size n containing float values, we could use the
following serial for loop to pass each value in v to the apply() function:
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
apply(v[i]);
}
A developer could manually apply data parallelism (Section 4.2.2) on a
multicore system by assigning different regions of the array v to each pro-
cessing core; however, this ties the technique for achieving parallelism closely
to the physical hardware, and the algorithm would have to be modified and
recompiled for the number of processing cores on each specific architecture.
Alternatively, a developer could use TBB, which provides a parallel for
template that expects two values:
parallel for (range
body )
where range refers to the range of elements that will be iterated (known as the
iteration space) and body specifies an operation that will be performed on a
subrange of elements.
We can now rewrite the above serial for loop using the TBB parallel for
template as follows:
parallel for (size t(0), n, [=](size t i) {apply(v[i]);});
The first two parameters specify that the iteration space is from 0 to n−1 (which
corresponds to the number of elements in the array v). The second parameter
is a C++ lambda function that requires a bit of explanation. The expression
[=](size t i) is the parameter i, which assumes each of the values over the
iteration space (in this case from 0 to 𝚗−1). Each value of i is used to identify
which array element in v is to be passed as a parameter to the apply(v[i])
function.
The TBB library will divide the loop iterations into separate “chunks” and
create a number of tasks that operate on those chunks. (The parallel for
function allows developers to manually specify the size of the chunks if they
wish to.) TBB will also create a number of threads and assign tasks to available
threads. This is quite similar to the fork-join library in Java. The advantage of
this approach is that it requires only that developers identify what operations
can run in parallel (by specifying a parallel for loop), and the library man-
Threads & Concurrency
ages the details involved in dividing the work into separate tasks that run in
parallel. Intel TBB has both commercial and open-source versions that run on
Windows, Linux, and macOS. Refer to the bibliography for further details on
how to develop parallel applications using TBB.


## 4.6 Threading Issues
> id: ch04-4-6 | src: book 4.6; slides 49-57 | kind: concept

In this section, we discuss some of the issues to consider in designing multi-
threaded programs.
The fork() and exec() System Calls
In Chapter 3, we described how the fork() system call is used to create a
separate, duplicate process. The semantics of the fork() and exec() system
calls change in a multithreaded program.
If one thread in a program calls fork(), does the new process duplicate
all threads, or is the new process single-threaded? Some UNIX systems have
chosen to have two versions of fork(), one that duplicates all threads and
another that duplicates only the thread that invoked the fork() system call.
The exec() system call typically works in the same way as described in
Chapter 3. That is, if a thread invokes the exec() system call, the program
specified in the parameter to exec() will replace the entire process—including
all threads.
Which of the two versions of fork() to use depends on the application.
If exec() is called immediately after forking, then duplicating all threads is
unnecessary, as the program specified in the parameters to exec() will replace
the process. In this instance, duplicating only the calling thread is appropri-
ate. If, however, the separate process does not call exec() after forking, the
separate process should duplicate all threads.
Signal Handling
A signal is used in UNIX systems to notify a process that a particular event has
occurred. A signal may be received either synchronously or asynchronously,
depending on the source of and the reason for the event being signaled. All
signals, whether synchronous or asynchronous, follow the same pattern:
1. A signal is generated by the occurrence of a particular event.
2. The signal is delivered to a process.
3. Once delivered, the signal must be handled.
Examples of synchronous signals include illegal memory access and divi-
sion by 0. If a running program performs either of these actions, a signal is gen-
erated. Synchronous signals are delivered to the same process that performed
the operation that caused the signal (that is the reason they are considered
synchronous).
When a signal is generated by an event external to a running process, that
process receives the signal asynchronously. Examples of such signals include
terminating a process with specific keystrokes (such as <control><C>) and


- Semantics of fork() and exec() system calls
- Signal handling
  - Synchronous and asynchronous
- Thread cancellation of target thread
  - Asynchronous or deferred
- Thread-local storage
- Scheduler Activations


**Semantics of fork() and exec()**

- Does fork()duplicate only the calling thread or all threads?
  - Some UNIXes have two versions of fork
- exec() usually works as normal – replace the running process including all threads


**Signal Handling**

- Signals are used in UNIX systems to notify a process that a particular event has occurred.
- A signal handler is used to process signals
  - Signal is generated by particular event
  - Signal is delivered to a process
  - Signal is handled by one of two signal handlers:
    - default
    - user-defined
- Every signal has default handler that kernel runs when handling signal
  - User-defined signal handler can override default
  - For single-threaded, signal delivered to process


**Signal Handling (Cont.)**

- Where should a signal be delivered for multi-threaded?
  - Deliver the signal to the thread to which the signal applies
  - Deliver the signal to every thread in the process
  - Deliver the signal to certain threads in the process
  - Assign a specific thread to receive all signals for the process


**Thread Cancellation**

- Terminating a thread before it has finished
- Thread to be canceled is target thread
- Two general approaches:
  - Asynchronous cancellation terminates the target thread immediately
  - Deferred cancellation allows the target thread to periodically check if it should be cancelled
- Pthread code to create and cancel a thread:

**Thread Cancellation (Cont.)**

- Invoking thread cancellation requests cancellation, but actual cancellation depends on thread state
- If thread has cancellation disabled, cancellation remains pending until thread enables it
- Default type is deferred
  - Cancellation only occurs when thread reaches cancellation point
    - i.e., pthread_testcancel()
    - Then cleanup handler is invoked
- On Linux systems, thread cancellation is handled through signals

**Thread Cancellation in Java**

- Deferred cancellation uses the interrupt() method, which sets the interrupted status of a thread.
- A thread can then check to see if it has been interrupted:

**Thread-Local Storage**

- Thread-local storage (TLS) allows each thread to have its own copy of data
- Useful when you do not have control over the thread creation process (i.e., when using a thread pool)
- Different from local variables
  - Local variables visible only during single function invocation
  - TLS visible across function invocations
- Similar to static data
  - TLS is unique to each thread


**Scheduler Activations**

- Both M:M and Two-level models require communication to maintain the appropriate number of kernel threads allocated to the application
- Typically use an intermediate data structure between user and kernel threads – lightweight process (LWP)
  - Appears to be a virtual processor on which process can schedule user thread to run
  - Each LWP attached to kernel thread
  - How many LWPs to create?
- Scheduler activations provide upcalls - a communication mechanism from the kernel to the upcall handler in the thread library
- This communication allows an application to maintain the correct number kernel threads

having a timer expire. Typically, an asynchronous signal is sent to another
process.
A signal may be handled by one of two possible handlers:
1. A default signal handler
2. A user-defined signal handler
Every signal has a default signal handler that the kernel runs when han-
dling that signal. This default action can be overridden by a user-define
signal handler that is called to handle the signal. Signals are handled in differ-
ent ways. Some signals may be ignored, while others (for example, an illegal
memory access) are handled by terminating the program.
Handling signals in single-threaded programs is straightforward: signals
are always delivered to a process. However, delivering signals is more compli-
cated in multithreaded programs, where a process may have several threads.
Where, then, should a signal be delivered?
In general, the following options exist:
1. Deliver the signal to the thread to which the signal applies.
2. Deliver the signal to every thread in the process.
3. Deliver the signal to certain threads in the process.
4. Assign a specific thread to receive all signals for the process.
The method for delivering a signal depends on the type of signal generated.
For example, synchronous signals need to be delivered to the thread causing
the signal and not to other threads in the process. However, the situation with
asynchronous signals is not as clear. Some asynchronous signals—such as a
signal that terminates a process (<control><C>, for example)—should be
sent to all threads.
The standard UNIX function for delivering a signal is
kill(pid t pid, int signal)
This function specifies the process (pid) to which a particular signal (signal) is
to be delivered. Most multithreaded versions of UNIX allow a thread to specify
which signals it will accept and which it will block. Therefore, in some cases,
an asynchronous signal may be delivered only to those threads that are not
blocking it. However, because signals need to be handled only once, a signal is
typically delivered only to the first thread found that is not blocking it. POSIX
Pthreads provides the following function, which allows a signal to be delivered
to a specified thread (tid):
pthread kill(pthread t tid, int signal)
Although Windows does not explicitly provide support for signals, it
allows us to emulate them using asynchronous procedure calls (APCs). The
APC facility enables a user thread to specify a function that is to be called
when the user thread receives notification of a particular event. As indicated
Threads & Concurrency
by its name, an APC is roughly equivalent to an asynchronous signal in UNIX.
However, whereas UNIX must contend with how to deal with signals in a mul-
tithreaded environment, the APC facility is more straightforward, since an APC
is delivered to a particular thread rather than a process.
Thread Cancellation
Thread cancellation involves terminating a thread before it has completed. For
example, if multiple threads are concurrently searching through a database
and one thread returns the result, the remaining threads might be canceled.
Another situation might occur when a user presses a button on a web browser
that stops a web page from loading any further. Often, a web page loads
using several threads—each image is loaded in a separate thread. When a
user presses the stop button on the browser, all threads loading the page are
canceled.
A thread that is to be canceled is often referred to as the target thread.
Cancellation of a target thread may occur in two different scenarios:
1. Asynchronous cancellation. One thread immediately terminates the tar-
get thread.
2. Deferred cancellation. The target thread periodically checks whether it
should terminate, allowing it an opportunity to terminate itself in an
orderly fashion.
The difficulty with cancellation occurs in situations where resources have
been allocated to a canceled thread or where a thread is canceled while in
the midst of updating data it is sharing with other threads. This becomes
especially troublesome with asynchronous cancellation. Often, the operating
system will reclaim system resources from a canceled thread but will not
reclaim all resources. Therefore, canceling a thread asynchronously may not
free a necessary system-wide resource.
With deferred cancellation, in contrast, one thread indicates that a target
thread is to be canceled, but cancellation occurs only after the target thread has
checked a flag to determine whether or not it should be canceled. The thread
can perform this check at a point at which it can be canceled safely.
In Pthreads, thread cancellation is initiated using the pthread cancel()
function. The identifier of the target thread is passed as a parameter to the func-
tion. The following code illustrates creating—and then canceling—a thread:
pthread t tid;
/* create the thread */
pthread create(&tid, 0, worker, NULL);
. . .
/* cancel the thread */
pthread cancel(tid);
/* wait for the thread to terminate */
pthread join(tid,NULL);


## 4.6 Threading Issues
> id: ch04-4-6 | src: book 4.6 | kind: concept

Invoking pthread cancel()indicates only a request to cancel the target
thread, however; actual cancellation depends on how the target thread is set
up to handle the request. When the target thread is finally canceled, the call
to pthread join() in the canceling thread returns. Pthreads supports three
cancellation modes. Each mode is defined as a state and a type, as illustrated
in the table below. Athread may set its cancellation state and type using an API.
Mode
State
Type
Off
Disabled
–
Deferred
Enabled
Deferred
Asynchronous
Enabled
Asynchronous
As the table illustrates, Pthreads allows threads to disable or enable can-
cellation. Obviously, a thread cannot be canceled if cancellation is disabled.
However, cancellation requests remain pending, so the thread can later enable
cancellation and respond to the request.
The default cancellation type is deferred cancellation. However, cancella-
tion occurs only when a thread reaches a cancellation point. Most of the block-
ing system calls in the POSIX and standard C library are defined as cancellation
points, and these are listed when invoking the command man pthreads on a
Linux system. For example, the read() system call is a cancellation point that
allows cancelling a thread that is blocked while awaiting input from read().
One technique for establishing a cancellation point is to invoke the
pthread testcancel() function. If a cancellation request is found to be
pending, the call to pthread testcancel() will not return, and the thread
will terminate; otherwise, the call to the function will return, and the thread
will continue to run. Additionally, Pthreads allows a function known as a
cleanup handler to be invoked if a thread is canceled. This function allows
any resources a thread may have acquired to be released before the thread is
terminated.
The following code illustrates how a thread may respond to a cancellation
request using deferred cancellation:
while (1) {
/* do some work for awhile */
. . .
/* check if there is a cancellation request */
pthread testcancel();
}
Because of the issues described earlier, asynchronous cancellation is not
recommended in Pthreads documentation. Thus, we do not cover it here.
An interesting note is that on Linux systems, thread cancellation using the
Pthreads API is handled through signals (Section 4.6.2).
Thread cancellation in Java uses a policy similar to deferred cancellation in
Pthreads. To cancel a Java thread, you invoke the interrupt() method, which
sets the interruption status of the target thread to true:
Threads & Concurrency
Thread worker;
. . .
/* set the interruption status of the thread */
worker.interrupt()
A thread can check its interruption status by invoking the isInter-
rupted() method, which returns a boolean value of a thread’s interruption
status:
while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
. . .
}
Thread-Local Storage
Threads belonging to a process share the data of the process. Indeed, this
data sharing provides one of the benefits of multithreaded programming.
However, in some circumstances, each thread might need its own copy of
certain data. We will call such data thread-local storage (or TLS). For example,
in a transaction-processing system, we might service each transaction in a
separate thread. Furthermore, each transaction might be assigned a unique
identifier. To associate each thread with its unique transaction identifier, we
could use thread-local storage.
It is easy to confuse TLS with local variables. However, local variables
are visible only during a single function invocation, whereas TLS data are
visible across function invocations. Additionally, when the developer has no
control over the thread creation process—for example, when using an implicit
technique such as a thread pool—then an alternative approach is necessary.
In some ways, TLS is similar to static data; the difference is that TLS
data are unique to each thread. (In fact, TLS is usually declared as static.)
Most thread libraries and compilers provide support for TLS. For example,
Java provides a ThreadLocal<T> class with set() and get() methods for
ThreadLocal<T> objects. Pthreads includes the type pthread key t, which
provides a key that is specific to each thread. This key can then be used to access
TLS data. Microsoft’s C# language simply requires adding the storage attribute
[ThreadStatic] to declare thread-local data. The gcc compiler provides the
storage class keyword
thread for declaring TLS data. For example, if we
wished to assign a unique identifier for each thread, we would declare it as
follows:
static
thread int threadID;
Scheduler Activations
A final issue to be considered with multithreaded programs concerns commu-
nication between the kernel and the thread library, which may be required


## 4.6 Threading Issues
> id: ch04-4-6 | src: book 4.6 | kind: concept

by the many-to-many and two-level models discussed in Section 4.3.3. Such
coordination allows the number of kernel threads to be dynamically adjusted
to help ensure the best performance.
Many systems implementing either the many-to-many or the two-level
model place an intermediate data structure between the user and kernel
threads. This data structure—typically known as a lightweight process, or
LWP—is shown in Figure 4.20. To the user-thread library, the LWP appears to
be a virtual processor on which the application can schedule a user thread to
run. Each LWP is attached to a kernel thread, and it is kernel threads that the
operating system schedules to run on physical processors. If a kernel thread
blocks (such as while waiting for an I/O operation to complete), the LWP blocks
as well. Up the chain, the user-level thread attached to the LWP also blocks.
An application may require any number of LWPs to run efficiently. Consider
a CPU-bound application running on a single processor. In this scenario, only
one thread can run at a time, so one LWP is sufficient. An application that is I/O-
intensive may require multiple LWPs to execute, however. Typically, an LWP is
required for each concurrent blocking system call. Suppose, for example, that
five different file-read requests occur simultaneously. Five LWPs are needed,
because all could be waiting for I/O completion in the kernel. If a process has
only four LWPs, then the fifth request must wait for one of the LWPs to return
from the kernel.
One scheme for communication between the user-thread library and the
kernel is known as scheduler activation. It works as follows: The kernel pro-
vides an application with a set of virtual processors (LWPs), and the application
can schedule user threads onto an available virtual processor. Furthermore,
the kernel must inform an application about certain events. This procedure is
known as an upcall. Upcalls are handled by the thread library with an upcall
handler, and upcall handlers must run on a virtual processor.
One event that triggers an upcall occurs when an application thread is
about to block. In this scenario, the kernel makes an upcall to the application
informing it that a thread is about to block and identifying the specific thread.
The kernel then allocates a new virtual processor to the application. The appli-
cation runs an upcall handler on this new virtual processor, which saves the
LWP

Threads & Concurrency
state of the blocking thread and relinquishes the virtual processor on which the
blocking thread is running. The upcall handler then schedules another thread
that is eligible to run on the new virtual processor. When the event that the
blocking thread was waiting for occurs, the kernel makes another upcall to the
thread library informing it that the previously blocked thread is now eligible
to run. The upcall handler for this event also requires a virtual processor, and
the kernel may allocate a new virtual processor or preempt one of the user
threads and run the upcall handler on its virtual processor. After marking the
unblocked thread as eligible to run, the application schedules an eligible thread
to run on an available virtual processor.


## 4.7 Operating-System Examples
> id: ch04-4-7 | src: book 4.7 | kind: concept

At this point, we have examined a number of concepts and issues related to
threads. We conclude the chapter by exploring how threads are implemented
in Windows and Linux systems.
Windows Threads
A Windows application runs as a separate process, and each process may
contain one or more threads. The Windows API for creating threads is covered
in Section 4.4.2. Additionally, Windows uses the one-to-one mapping described
in Section 4.3.2, where each user-level thread maps to an associated kernel
thread.
The general components of a thread include:
• A thread ID uniquely identifying the thread
• A register set representing the status of the processor
• A program counter
• A user stack, employed when the thread is running in user mode, and a
kernel stack, employed when the thread is running in kernel mode
• Aprivate storage area used by various run-time libraries and dynamic link
libraries (DLLs)
The register set, stacks, and private storage area are known as the context of
the thread.
The primary data structures of a thread include:
• ETHREAD—executive thread block
• KTHREAD—kernel thread block
• TEB—thread environment block
The key components of the ETHREAD include a pointer to the process
to which the thread belongs and the address of the routine in which the
thread starts control. The ETHREAD also contains a pointer to the corresponding
KTHREAD.

The KTHREAD includes scheduling and synchronization information for
the thread. In addition, the KTHREAD includes the kernel stack (used when the
thread is running in kernel mode) and a pointer to the TEB.
The ETHREAD and the KTHREAD exist entirely in kernel space; this means
that only the kernel can access them. The TEB is a user-space data structure
that is accessed when the thread is running in user mode. Among other fields,
the TEB contains the thread identifier, a user-mode stack, and an array for
thread-local storage. The structure of a Windows thread is illustrated in Figure
4.21.
Linux Threads
Linux provides the fork() system call with the traditional functionality of
duplicating a process, as described in Chapter 3. Linux also provides the ability
to create threads using the clone() system call. However, Linux does not
distinguish between processes and threads. In fact, Linux uses the term task
—rather than process or thread— when referring to a flow of control within a
program.
When clone() is invoked, it is passed a set of flags that determine how
much sharing is to take place between the parent and child tasks. Some of these
flags are listed in Figure 4.22. For example, suppose that clone() is passed
the flags CLONE FS, CLONE VM, CLONE SIGHAND, and CLONE FILES. The parent
and child tasks will then share the same file-system information (such as the
current working directory), the same memory space, the same signal handlers,

File-system information is shared.
The same memory space is shared.
Signal handlers are shared.
The set of open files is shared.

and the same set of open files. Using clone() in this fashion is equivalent to
creating a thread as described in this chapter, since the parent task shares most
of its resources with its child task. However, if none of these flags is set when
clone() is invoked, no sharing takes place, resulting in functionality similar
to that provided by the fork() system call.
The varying level of sharing is possible because of the way a task is repre-
sented in the Linux kernel. A unique kernel data structure (specifically, struct
task struct) exists for each task in the system. This data structure, instead
of storing data for the task, contains pointers to other data structures where
these data are stored—for example, data structures that represent the list of
open files, signal-handling information, and virtual memory. When fork() is
invoked, a new task is created, along with a copy of all the associated data
structures of the parent process. A new task is also created when the clone()
system call is made. However, rather than copying all data structures, the new
task points to the data structures of the parent task, depending on the set of
flags passed to clone().
Finally, the flexibility of the clone() system call can be extended to the
concept of containers, a virtualization topic which was introduced in Chapter
1. Recall from that chapter that a container is a virtualization technique pro-
vided by the operating system that allows creating multiple Linux systems
(containers) under a single Linux kernel that run in isolation to one another.
Just as certain flags passed to clone() can distinguish between creating a task
that behaves more like a process or a thread based upon the amount of sharing
between the parent and child tasks, there are other flags that can be passed to
clone() that allow a Linux container to be created. Containers will be covered
more fully in Chapter 18.


## 4.8 Summary
> id: ch04-4-8 | src: book 4.8 | kind: concept

• A thread represents a basic unit of CPU utilization, and threads belonging
to the same process share many of the process resources, including code
and data.
• There are four primary benefits to multithreaded applications: (1) respon-
siveness, (2) resource sharing, (3) economy, and (4) scalability.
• Concurrency exists when multiple threads are making progress, whereas
parallelism exists when multiple threads are making progress simulta-

neously. On a system with a single CPU, only concurrency is possible;
parallelism requires a multicore system that provides multiple CPUs.
• There are several challenges in designing multithreaded applications.
They include dividing and balancing the work, dividing the data between
the different threads, and identifying any data dependencies. Finally, mul-
tithreaded programs are especially challenging to test and debug.
• Data parallelism distributes subsets of the same data across different com-
puting cores and performs the same operation on each core. Task paral-
lelism distributes not data but tasks across multiple cores. Each task is
running a unique operation.
• User applications create user-level threads, which must ultimately be
mapped to kernel threads to execute on a CPU. The many-to-one model
maps many user-level threads to one kernel thread. Other approaches
include the one-to-one and many-to-many models.
• A thread library provides an API for creating and managing threads. Three
common thread libraries include Windows, Pthreads, and Java threading.
Windows is for the Windows system only, while Pthreads is available for
POSIX-compatible systems such as UNIX, Linux, and macOS. Java threads
will run on any system that supports a Java virtual machine.
• Implicit threading involves identifying tasks—not threads—and allowing
languages or API frameworks to create and manage threads. There are
several approaches to implicit threading, including thread pools, fork-join
frameworks, and Grand Central Dispatch. Implicit threading is becoming
an increasingly common technique for programmers to use in developing
concurrent and parallel applications.
• Threads may be terminated using either asynchronous or deferred cancel-
lation. Asynchronous cancellation stops a thread immediately, even if it
is in the middle of performing an update. Deferred cancellation informs
a thread that it should terminate but allows the thread to terminate in an
orderly fashion. In most circumstances, deferred cancellation is preferred
to asynchronous termination.
• Unlike many other operating systems, Linux does not distinguish between
processes and threads; instead, it refers to each as a task. The Linux
clone() system call can be used to create tasks that behave either more
like processes or more like threads.

for scheduling. A CPU-intensive application is running on this system.
All input is performed at program start-up, when a single file must be

opened. Similarly, all output is performed just before the program termi-
nates, when the program results must be written to a single file. Between
start-up and termination, the program is entirely CPU-bound. Your task
is to improve the performance of this application by multithreading it.
The application runs on a system that uses the one-to-one threading
model (each user thread maps to a kernel thread).

As described in Section 4.7.2, Linux does not distinguish between pro-
cesses and threads. Instead, Linux treats both in the same way, allowing a
task to be more akin to a process or a thread depending on the set of flags
passed to the clone() system call. However, other operating systems,
such as Windows, treat processes and threads differently. Typically, such
systems use a notation in which the data structure for a process contains
pointers to the separate threads belonging to the process. Contrast these
two approaches for modeling processes and threads within the kernel.
The program shown in Figure 4.23 uses the Pthreads API. What would
be the output from the program at LINE C and LINE P?
Consider a multicore system and a multithreaded program written

Write a multithreaded program that calculates various statistical values
for a list of numbers. This program will be passed a series of numbers
on the command line and will then create three separate worker threads.
One thread will determine the average of the numbers, the second will
determine the maximum value, and the third will determine the mini-
mum value. For example, suppose your program is passed the integers
90 81 78 95 79 72 85
The program will report
The average value is 82
The minimum value is 72
The maximum value is 95
The variables representing the average, minimum, and maximum values
will be stored globally. The worker threads will set these values, and
the parent thread will output the values once the workers have exited.
(We could obviously expand this program by creating additional threads
that determine other statistical values, such as median and standard
deviation.)
Write a multithreaded program that outputs prime numbers. This pro-
gram should work as follows: The user will run the program and will
enter a number on the command line. The program will then create a
separate thread that outputs all the prime numbers less than or equal to
the number entered by the user.
An interesting way of calculating π is to use a technique known as Monte
Carlo, which involves randomization. This technique works as follows:
Suppose you have a circle inscribed within a square, as shown in
Figure 4.25. (Assume that the radius of this circle is 1.)
• First, generate a series of random points as simple (x, y) coordinates.
These points must fall within the Cartesian coordinates that bound
the square. Of the total number of random points that are generated,
some will occur within the circle.
• Next, estimate π by performing the following calculation:
π = 4× (number of points in circle) / (total number of points)
Write a multithreaded version of this algorithm that creates a separate
thread to generate a number of random points. The thread will count
the number of points that occur within the circle and store that result
in a global variable. When this thread has exited, the parent thread will
calculate and output the estimated value of π. It is worth experimenting
with the number of random points generated. As a general rule, the
greater the number of points, the closer the approximation to π.

Monte Carlo technique for calculating π.
In the source-code download for this text, you will find a sample
program that provides a technique for generating random numbers, as
well as determining if the random (x, y) point occurs within the circle.
Readers interested in the details of the Monte Carlo method for
estimating π should consult the bibliography at the end of this chapter.
In Chapter 6, we modify this exercise using relevant material from that
chapter.
Repeat Exercise 4.24, but instead of using a separate thread to generate
random points, use OpenMP to parallelize the generation of points. Be
careful not to place the calculation of π in the parallel region, since you
want to calculate π only once.
Modify the socket-based date server (Figure 3.27) in Chapter 3 so that
the server services each client request in a separate thread.
The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, .... For-
mally, it can be expressed as:
fib0 = 0
fib1 = 1
fibn = fibn−1 + fibn−2
Write a multithreaded program that generates the Fibonacci sequence.
This program should work as follows: On the command line, the user
will enter the number of Fibonacci numbers that the program is to gen-
erate. The program will then create a separate thread that will generate
the Fibonacci numbers, placing the sequence in data that can be shared
by the threads (an array is probably the most convenient data struc-
ture). When the thread finishes execution, the parent thread will output
the sequence generated by the child thread. Because the parent thread
cannot begin outputting the Fibonacci sequence until the child thread
finishes, the parent thread will have to wait for the child thread to finish.
Use the techniques described in Section 4.4 to meet this requirement.
Modify programming problem Exercise 3.20 from Chapter 3, which asks
you to design a pid manager. This modification will consist of writing a
P-24
Programming Problems
multithreaded program that tests your solution to Exercise 3.20. You will
create a number of threads—for example, 100—and each thread will
request a pid, sleep for a random period of time, and then release the
pid. (Sleeping for a random period of time approximates the typical pid
usage in which a pid is assigned to a new process, the process executes
and then terminates, and the pid is released on the process’s termina-
tion.) On UNIX and Linux systems, sleeping is accomplished through
the sleep() function, which is passed an integer value representing the
number of seconds to sleep. This problem will be modified in Chapter 7.
Exercise 3.25 in Chapter 3 involves designing an echo server using the
Java threading API. This server is single-threaded, meaning that the
server cannot respond to concurrent echo clients until the current client
exits. Modify the solution to Exercise 3.25 so that the echo server services
each client in a separate request.

Programming Projects
Project 1—Sudoku Solution Validator
A Sudoku puzzle uses a 9 × 9 grid in which each column and row, as well as
each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids, must contain all of the digits 1 ⋅⋅⋅9. Figure


## 4.26 presents an example of a valid Sudoku puzzle. This project consists of
> id: ch04-4-26 | src: book 4.26 | kind: concept

designing a multithreaded application that determines whether the solution
to a Sudoku puzzle is valid.
There are several different ways of multithreading this application. One
suggested strategy is to create threads that check the following criteria:
• A thread to check that each column contains the digits 1 through 9
• A thread to check that each row contains the digits 1 through 9
P-25
Threads & Concurrency
• Nine threads to check that each of the 3 × 3 subgrids contains the digits 1
through 9
This would result in a total of eleven separate threads for validating a
Sudoku puzzle. However, you are welcome to create even more threads for
this project. For example, rather than creating one thread that checks all nine
columns, you could create nine separate threads and have each of them check
one column.
I. Passing Parameters to Each Thread
The parent thread will create the worker threads, passing each worker the
location that it must check in the Sudoku grid. This step will require passing
several parameters to each thread. The easiest approach is to create a data
structure using a struct. For example, a structure to pass the row and column
where a thread must begin validating would appear as follows:
/* structure for passing data to threads */
typedef struct
{
int row;
int column;
} parameters;
Both Pthreads and Windows programs will create worker threads using a
strategy similar to that shown below:
parameters *data = (parameters *) malloc(sizeof(parameters));
data->row = 1;
data->column = 1;
/* Now create the thread passing it data as a parameter */
The data pointer will be passed to either the pthread create() (Pthreads)
function or the CreateThread() (Windows) function, which in turn will pass
it as a parameter to the function that is to run as a separate thread.
II. Returning Results to the Parent Thread
Each worker thread is assigned the task of determining the validity of a partic-
ular region of the Sudoku puzzle. Once a worker has performed this check, it
must pass its results back to the parent. One good way to handle this is to create
an array of integer values that is visible to each thread. The ith index in this
array corresponds to the ith worker thread. If a worker sets its corresponding
value to 1, it is indicating that its region of the Sudoku puzzle is valid. A value
of 0 indicates otherwise. When all worker threads have completed, the parent
thread checks each entry in the result array to determine if the Sudoku puzzle
is valid.
Project 2—Multithreaded Sorting Application
Write a multithreaded sorting program that works as follows: A list of integers
is divided into two smaller lists of equal size. Two separate threads (which we
P-26
Programming Projects
will term sorting threads) sort each sublist using a sorting algorithm of your
choice. The two sublists are then merged by a third thread—a merging thread
—which merges the two sublists into a single sorted list.
Because global data are shared across all threads, perhaps the easiest way
to set up the data is to create a global array. Each sorting thread will work on
one half of this array. A second global array of the same size as the unsorted
integer array will also be established. The merging thread will then merge the
two sublists into this second array. Graphically, this program is structured as
in Figure 4.27.
This programming project will require passing parameters to each of the
sorting threads. In particular, it will be necessary to identify the starting index
from which each thread is to begin sorting. Refer to the instructions in Project
1 for details on passing parameters to a thread.
The parent thread will output the sorted array once all sorting threads have
exited.

Project 3—Fork-Join Sorting Application
Implement the preceding project (Multithreaded Sorting Application) using
Java’s fork-join parallelism API. This project will be developed in two different
versions. Each version will implement a different divide-and-conquer sorting
algorithm:
1. Quicksort
2. Mergesort
The Quicksort implementation will use the Quicksort algorithm for dividing
the list of elements to be sorted into a left half and a right half based on the
P-27
Threads & Concurrency
position of the pivot value. The Mergesort algorithm will divide the list into
two evenly sized halves. For both the Quicksort and Mergesort algorithms,
when the list to be sorted falls within some threshold value (for example, the
list is size 100 or fewer), directly apply a simple algorithm such as the Selection
or Insertion sort. Most data structures texts describe these two well-known,
divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms.
The class SumTask shown in Section 4.5.2.1 extends RecursiveTask, which
is a result-bearing ForkJoinTask. As this assignment will involve sorting
the array that is passed to the task, but not returning any values, you will
instead create a class that extends RecursiveAction, a non result-bearing
ForkJoinTask (see Figure 4.19).
The objects passed to each sorting algorithm are required to implement
Java’s Comparable interface, and this will need to be reflected in the class
definition for each sorting algorithm. The source code download for this text
includes Java code that provides the foundations for beginning this project.
